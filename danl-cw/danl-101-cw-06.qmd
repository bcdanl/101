# Question 1. `data.frame`
In a data frame, what form does a variable take?

**Answer**: Column

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-07-2024-0917.html#/r-basics-5) in Lecture 7 explains what make a data.frame tidy. In our course, all given data.frames are tidy.

<br><br>

# Question 2. `left_join()`
```{r}
df_joined <- df_1 |> ___(df_2)
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to join the two related data.frames, `df_1` and `df_2`, in a way that keeps all observations and variables in the data.frame `df_1`.

**Answer**: `left_join`

```{r}
df_joined <- df_1 |> left_join(df_2)
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-10-2024-0926.html#/relational-databases) in Lecture 10 and [this slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/relational-data) in Lecture 11 explain **join** and `left_join()`.


<br><br>

# Question 3. `==` (Equality operator)
```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(num __ 9) 
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to keep observations, in which the value of the `num` variable is equal to 9.

**Answer**: `==`

```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(num == 9) 
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-1) and [this slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-4) in Lecture 11 explain an equality operator, `==` (equal to).


<br><br>

# Question 4. `!=` (Not-equal operator)
```{r}
non_dec <- df |> filter(month ___ 12)
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to keep observations, in which the value of the `month` is not equal to 12 in the data.frame `df`

**Answer**: `!=`

```{r}
non_dec <- df |> filter(month != 12)
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-4) and [Line 105-106 in this class R script](https://github.com/bcdanl/101-04-R/blob/master/danl-101-04-2024-1001.R) in Lecture 11 explain a not-equal operator, `!=` (not equal to).



<br><br>



# Question 5. `|` (Or operator)
```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(subject == "DANL" ___ subject == "ECON")
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to keep observations, in which the value of the `subject` variable is either "DANL" or "ECON"

**Answer**: `|`

```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(subject == "DANL" | subject == "ECON")
```


- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-2) and [this slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-7) in Lecture 11 explain logical operation, `|` (or).

-	Please note that `|` is not the letter "I" or "l," but a vertical bar character.
  - On a keyboard, `|` is located above the *Enter/Return* key.
