# Question 1. `data.frame`
In a data frame, what form does an observation take?

**Answer**: Row

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-07-2024-0917.html#/r-basics-5) in Lecture 7 explains what makes a data.frame tidy. In our course, all given data.frames are tidy.


- In a data.frame:
  - A variable takes a column
  - An observation takes a row
  - A value takes a cell

<br><br>

# Question 2. `nrow()`
```{r}
___(df)
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to calculate the number of observations in the data.frame, `df`.

**Answer**: `nrow`

```{r}
nrow(df)
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-06-2024-0912.html?q=nrow#/r-basics-5) in Lecture 6 and [a couple of class R scripts](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Abcdanl%2F101-04-R%20nrow&type=code) explain `nrow()`.


<br><br>

# Question 3. `>=` (Greater-than-or-equal-to operator)
```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(num __ 9)
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to keep observations, in which the value of the `num` variable is greater than or equal to 9.

**Answer**: `>=`

```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(num >= 9)
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-4) in Lecture 11 and [this class R script](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Abcdanl%2F101-04-R+%3E%3D&type=code) explain this inequality operator.


<br><br>

# Question 4. `!` (Negation operator)
```{r}
non_dec <-  df |> filter( ___(month == 12) )
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to keep observations, in which the value of the `month` variable is not equal to 12 in the data.frame `df`.

**Answer**: `!`

```{r}
non_dec <-  df |> filter( !(month == 12) )
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-2) in Lecture 11 and [Line 40-41 in this class R script](https://github.com/bcdanl/101-04-R/blob/c2a9a17958735d8830885c6e490c3a5083d63e68/danl-101-04-2024-1003.R#L41) explain a negation operator, `!` (not).

- A more natural way to write this line is using `!=` (not-equal operator):

```{r}
non_dec <-  df |> filter( month != 12 )
```


<br><br>



# Question 5. `&` (And operator)
```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(subject == "DANL" ___ number == 101)
```

- Fill in the blank (___) to keep observations, in which the value of the `subject` variable is "DANL" and the value of the `number` variable is 101.

**Answer**: `&` (`,`)

```{r}
df_filtered <- df |> filter(subject == "DANL" & number == 101)
df_filtered <- df |> filter(subject == "DANL", number == 101)
```

- [This slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-2) and [this slide](https://bcdanl.github.io/101/danl-lec/danl-101-lec-11-2024-1001.html#/filter-observations-with-filter-5) in Lecture 11 explain logical operation, `&` (and).
