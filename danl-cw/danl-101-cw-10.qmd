# NBC Show Data

The `nbc_show` data is from NBCâ€™s TV pilots:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
nbc_show <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nbc_show.csv")
```

- Gross Ratings Points (`GRP`): estimated total viewership of the show, which measures broadcast marketability.
  - A higher GRP suggests broader exposure and a potentially more marketable show.

- Projected Engagement (`PE`): how engaged viewers were after watching a show, a more suitable measure of audience.
  - After watching a show, a viewer is quizzed on order and detail.
  - This measures their engagement with the show (and ads!).
  - High PE values suggest strong engagement.

```{r}
#| echo: false

DT::datatable(nbc_show, options = list(
  pageLength = 40
))
```


## Q1a
- Provide `ggplot()` code to describe the relationship between `GRP` and `PE`.

<br>


## Q1b
- Provide `ggplot()` code to describe how the relationship between `GRP` and `PE` varies by `Genre`.

<br>

## Q1c
- What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the `color` aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
