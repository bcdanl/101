<br>


## Question 2
When the distribution of a variable has a single peak and is negatively skewed (i.e., having a long left tail), which of the following is correct?

a. Median < Mode < Mean
b. Mean < Median < Mode
c. Mode < Mean < Median
d. Median = Mean = Mode

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

# Section 3. Data Transformation and Visualization with R

## Questions 13-19
For **Questions 13-19**, consider the following R packages and the data.frame, `esg_info`, containing individual company statistics for the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risk score in 2024.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false


library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
esg_info <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/stock_esg_simple.csv")
```

- The `esg_info` data.frame is with 631 observations and 7 variables.
- The first 5 observations in the `esg_info` data.frame are displayed below:

```{r}
#| echo: false


knitr::kable(esg_info |> select(Ticker:sector, total_esg) |> slice(1:5))

knitr::kable(esg_info |> select(Ticker:sector, environmental:governance) |> slice(1:5))

```


### Description of Variables in `esg_info`:
  
- `Ticker`: The stock symbol used to uniquely identify a publicly traded company on financial markets.
- `Company_Name`: The full name of the company corresponding to the ticker symbol.
- `sector`: The broader industry category to which the company belongs, such as Technology, Healthcare, or Financials.
- `total_esg`: The company’s overall Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score. It reflects how well the company is performing in terms of sustainability and ethical impact.
-	`environmental`: The company’s score related to environmental practices, such as energy efficiency, waste management, and carbon footprint.
-	`social`: The company’s score related to social practices, including employee relations, diversity, community impact, and human rights.
-	`governance`: The company’s score related to governance practices, like board structure, executive pay, and shareholder rights.


### Interpreting ESG Data

The **ESG data** helps investors evaluate a company’s sustainability profile and exposure to long-term environmental, social, and governance risks. Here's how to interpret each metric:


#### **Total ESG Risk Score**
- **What it means**: A composite score reflecting the company’s overall **exposure to ESG-related risks**.
- **How to interpret**:  
  - **Higher score = higher risk** → More vulnerable to ESG-related issues.  
  - *Example*: A company with **total_ESG = 15** is considered to have **lower ESG risk** than one with **total_ESG = 30**.


#### **Environmental Risk Score**
- **What it measures**: Exposure to **environmental risks** such as:
  - Carbon emissions, waste management, climate change strategy  
  - Higher score → more environmental liabilities or poor sustainability measures.


#### **Social Risk Score**
- **What it measures**: Exposure to **social risks**, including:
  - Labor practices, human rights, inclusive culture and representation, customer and community relations  
  - Higher score = more risk from labor issues, public relation (PR) problems, etc.


#### **Governance Risk Score**
- **What it measures**: Exposure to **governance-related risks**, such as:
  - Board structure and independence, executive compensation, shareholder rights, transparency and ethics  
  - Higher score suggests poor governance structures.

### Question 16
- We are interested in companies whose overall ESG performance is relatively weak.
- To achieve this, we create a new data.frame, a new data.frame, `bottom25_esg`, which includes only companies whose `total_esg` value is greater than or equal to the **third quartile** of `total_esg` variable.

```{r}
#| echo: false
bottom25_esg <- esg_info |> 
  filter(total_esg >= 26.1)
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
bottom25_esg <- esg_info |> 
  filter(total_esg >= ___BLANK___)

### Question 17
- Additionally, we are interested in companies with excellent environmental or governance performance, despite having weak overall ESG scores.
- To achieve this, we create a new data.frame, `bottom25_esg_filtered`, which includes only companies whose `environmental` risk score is at most **3.95** or whose `governance` risk score is at most **5.2**.

```{r}
#| echo: false
bottom25_esg_filtered <- bottom25_esg |> 
  filter(environmental <= 3.95 | governance <= 5.2)
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
bottom25_esg_filtered <- esg_info |> 
  filter(___BLANK___)
```


- Which condition correctly fills in the BLANK to complete the code above?

a. `environmental <= 3.95 | governance <= 5.2`
b. `environmental <= 3.95 , governance <= 5.2`
c. `environmental <= 3.95 & governance <= 5.2`
d. `environmental <= 3.95 ! governance <= 5.2`
e. Both (b) and (c)

#### Relationship
Describe the *overall* relationship between `environmental` and `governance`, in the given plot.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
##### Show answer
<!-- Overall, `governance` decreases as `environmental` increases up to 10, after which it remains relatively constant. -->

Overall, the `governance` risk score decreases as the `environmental` risk score increases up to about 10, after which it **levels off and remains relatively constant**. 

This pattern suggests that among companies with **weaker overall ESG performance**, **deterioration in environmental risk** is associated with **stronger governance up to a threshold**, beyond which further changes in environmental risk have **little additional correlation** with governance risk.

```


For Question 20, you will use the following R packages and a data.frame named `chess_top4`, which contains information about chess games played by four of the world’s top online chess players during a special event called “Titled Tuesday” on chess.com. These games were played in a format where each player has 3 minutes to make all their moves, with 1 second added to their clock after each move. The data includes games from October 2022 to October 2024 played only among the following four players:

1. **Magnus Carlsen**
2. **Hikaru Nakamura**
3. **Alireza Firouzja**
4. **Daniel Naroditsky**

**Note:** Titled Tuesday is a weekly event held every Tuesday on chess.com, where titled chess players (such as Grandmasters and International Masters) compete in online tournaments.


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false


library(tidyverse)
chess_top4 <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/chess_titled_tuesday.csv")
```



The first 15 observations in the `chess_top4` data.frame are displayed below:
```{r}
#| echo: false


knitr::kable(chess_top4 |> slice(1:15) )

```

- The `chess_top4` data.frame contains 70 observations and 4 variables, representing 70 unique chess games.

### Description of Variables in `chess_top4`:
  
- `Date`: The date when the game was played.

- `White`: The name of the player who played with the white pieces.

- `Black`: The name of the player who played with the black pieces.

- `Result`: The outcome of the game, which can be one of the following:
  - "White Wins" (the player with the white pieces won the game)
  - "Black Wins" (the player with the black pieces won the game)
  - "Draw" (the game ended in a tie)

Question 20 is about a **ggplot** code to visualize how the distribution of `Result` varies among these top 4 chess players.

# Section 3. Short Essay


## Question 21
Explain the "Connection Principle" in the context of line charts and why it is useful for visualizing time-series data.



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
The **Connection Principle** states that points in a line chart should be visually connected when the data represent a meaningful sequence, such as time. This connection helps viewers naturally perceive trends, patterns, growth, and cycles across periods. It is especially useful in time-series data because it reinforces the idea of continuity and change over time rather than treating each observation as isolated.

## Question 22
How does data storytelling bridge the gap between data and insights? 


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**Data Storytelling** bridges the gap between **data** and **insight** by integrating **descriptive statistics**, **data transformation**, **visualization**, and **narration** within the appropriate **audience context** to communicate findings effectively and support **data-informed decision-making**.

## Question 23
Provide two main reasons why the log transformation of a variable can be useful.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
Two main reasons for using a log transformation are:

1. It helps **reduce skewness** in highly right-skewed data, making the distribution more symmetric and the variation easier to see.  
2. It allows us to **interpret changes in percentage terms**, which is especially useful for growth rates and economic variables such as income, GDP, stock price, or housing price.

## Question 24
Provide at least three techniques to make data visualization more colorblind-friendly.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
To make visualizations more accessible and colorblind-friendly, consider:

1. Using **colorblind-friendly color palettes**
2. Adding **non-color cues** like **`shape`** to scatterplots or **`linetype`** to line charts
3. Including **additional visual cues** to highlight important information (e.g., annotations or labels)
4. Ensuring **strong contrast** between colors and between the foreground and background so that elements remain distinguishable.

## Question 25
For each of the workplaces represented by our three alumni guest speakers, explain how generative AI is used in their day-to-day work.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
Across the three alumni workplaces, generative AI is integrated into daily workflows in different but complementary ways.

At the **analytics and engineering–focused workplace**, many employees (roughly 60–80%) use AI assistants such as Copilot or Claude to support coding, debugging, and data processing. AI significantly speeds up routine analytical tasks, but all outputs still require **human review**, meaning AI **augments rather than replaces analysts**.

For a **traditional data analyst role**, generative AI is commonly used to assist with **SQL coding, data summarization, and report drafting**. Analysts rely on AI to improve efficiency, but **data sensitivity and responsible AI use** are essential, so such tools are typically deployed only within **secure internal environments**.

At the **policy and government-related workplace (e.g., the Federal Reserve)**, the use of **public AI tools like ChatGPT is prohibited** due to strict data confidentiality rules. Instead, analysts rely on approved internal systems and traditional analytical tools to protect sensitive economic and financial information.

Together, these examples show how generative AI is widely used to increase productivity, while **security, privacy, and human oversight remain central** across all workplaces.
