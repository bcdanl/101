### Question 16
Provide a comment to describe how the relationship between (1) the <u>natural log</u> of `sales` and (2) the <u>natural log</u> of `price` varies by brand?


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

-	In economics, the vertical axis typically represents price, while the horizontal axis represents quantity.
- However, for ease of interpretation, let’s switch the axes and use the natural logarithm:

```{r}
#| eval: true
ggplot(data = oj, 
       mapping = aes(x = log(price),
                     y = log(sales),
                     color = brand,
                     fill = brand)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-	We observe that sales decrease as price increases, which aligns with the basic economic principle of a downward-sloping demand curve: higher prices typically lead to lower sales.
  -	More specifically, sales decrease by a certain percentage (the slope) for every 1% increase in price. 
  - In economics, this concept is known as **price elasticity of demand**, which measures how responsive consumers are to price changes when buying orange juice.
-	Tropicana customers are less responsive to price changes compared to customers of other brands.
  -	Additionally, at the same price, Tropicana sells more than Minute Maid, which in turn sells more than Dominick’s.
  - This is expected, as Tropicana is considered a premium product and is more desirable at the same price point.

### Question 17
How would you visualize how the relationship between (1) the base-10 log of `sales` and (2) the base-10 log of `price` varies by `brand` and `ad_status`?

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
ggplot(data = oj, 
       mapping = aes(x = log10(sales),
                     y = log10(price),
                     color = brand,
                     fill = brand)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ad_status)  # create separate panels for each level of 'ad_status'
```


```{r}
#| eval: false

### Question 18
Provide a comment to describe how the relationship between (1) the natural log of `sales` and (2) the natural log of `price` varies by `brand` and `ad_status`.



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer
For interpretation purpose, let's use the natural log, and switch axes:
```{r}
#| eval: true
ggplot(data = oj, 
       mapping = aes(x = log(price),
                     y = log(sales),
                     color = brand,
                     fill = brand)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ad_status)
```

- The ads tend to change sales at all prices, they change price sensitivity, and they do both of these things in a brand-specific manner.

- We see that being advertised always leads to more price sensitivity, particularly the demand for Minute Maid is much more price sensitive than when it is not. 

- Why does this happen? 
  - One possible explanation is that advertisement increases the population of consumers who are considering your brand In particular, it can increase your market beyond brand loyalists, to include people who will be more price sensitive than those who reflexively buy your orange juice every week. Indeed, if you observe increased price sensitivity, it can be an indicator that your marketing efforts are expanding your consumer base. 
    - This why ad campaigns should usually be accompanied by price cuts!
  - There is also an alternative explanation. Since the advertised products are often also discounted, it could be that the demand curve is nonlinear—at lower price points the average consumer is more price sensitive. 
  - The truth is probably a combination of these effects.

### Question 20
Write a comment explaining how you would describe the yearly trends in hit percentages for each `hit_type` (e.g., **Single**, **Double**, **Triple**, and **HomeRun**).


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer


The trends in MLB show that doubles and home runs have increased steadily over the years, while singles and triples have shown a decline. This shift reflects changes in playing style, favoring power hitting and longer hits over traditional base-hitting strategies.

## General Tips on Describing the Distribution
- When describing the distribution of a variable, we are typically interested in several key characteristics:
	1. **Center**: The central tendency of the data, such as the **mean** or **median**, which indicates the **typical or average value**.
	2. **Spread**: How spread the values are within the variable, showing the **range** and **standard deviation** of values.
	2. **Common Values**: Identifying frequent values and the **mode**.
	3. **Rare Values**: Recognizing unusual or infrequent values.
	4. **Shape**: The overall shape of the distribution, such as whether it’s symmetric, skewed left or right, or having multiple groups with multiple peaks.

-	**Add Narration if Available**: If possible, connect the distribution to real-world phenomena and/or your idea that could help explain it, adding insight into what is happening.


<br>


## General Tips on Describing the Relationship Between Two Variables
1. Start with determining whether the two variables have a **positive association**, a **negative association**, or **no association**.
  - E.g., A negative slope in the fitted line indicates that sales decrease as the price increases, while a positive slope would indicate that sales increase with price. A zero slope means that there is no relationship between sales and price; changes in price do not affect sales.
  
<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/corr-direction.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

<br>
  
  
2. When a question asks you to describe how the relationship varies by another variable, examine both **the direction of the slope** (negative, positive, or none) from the fitted line and **the steepness of the slope** (steep or shallow).
  - The slope of the fitted straight line is the rate at which the “y” variable (like grades) changes as the “x” variable (like study hours) changes. In simple terms, it shows how much one thing goes up or down when the other thing changes.
  - For example, a comment such as, "The plot shows a negative relationship between sales and price" does not address how the relationship differs by brand
  
  
3. **Be specific.**
  - For example, a comment such as, “The plot illustrates how the relationship between the natural log of sales and the natural log of price varies across brands, with each brand showing a unique regression line and scatter pattern,” simply rephrases the question, and does not actually answer it at all.
  
  
4.	**The focus is on the relationship, not the distribution.**
  -	While adding a comment on the distribution of a single variable can be helpful, the question is primarily about the relationship between the two variables.
  
  
5.	**Add Narration if Available**: If possible, connect the relationship to real-world phenomena and/or your idea that could help explain it, adding insight into what is happening.


<br>

## General Tips on Describing the Time Trend of a Variable

1.	**Start with Identifying the Overall Trend**: Look for **the general direction of the trend over time**.
  - Is it moving **upward**, **downward**, or **remaining relatively constant**? 
  - **Be specific**: A comment like "The trend shows the evolution of hitting techniques in the MLB over time" simply rephrases the question, and does not actually answer it at all.
  
2.	**Note Patterns and Cycles**: Identify any repeating patterns, such as **seasonal fluctuations** (e.g., monthly or quarterly changes) or **long-term cycles**. These patterns can indicate regular influences on the variable over time.
3.	**Highlight Any Significant Fluctuations**: Describe any **sharp increases, decreases**, or **irregular spikes** in the data. 
4.	**Add Narration if Available**: If possible, connect trends to real-world events or factors and/or your idea that could explain them, helping to interpret why the trend behaves a certain way over time.
