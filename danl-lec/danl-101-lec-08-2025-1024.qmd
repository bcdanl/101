# **Summary for Jaehyung and Jason's Session**  {background-color="#1c4982"}

## 🧩 Roles & Workflows
- **Jaehyung (AI Enablement / Analytics at Invisible Technologies)**
  - Works with AI model companies like **OpenAI, Cohere, Google DeepMind**
  - Manages **data pipelines, automation, and analytics** with 20,000+ distributed agents
  - Emphasized **Streamlit apps, personal data projects**, and **building tools beyond class assignments**

## 🧩 Roles & Workflows
- **Jason (Data Engineer at Momentive)**
  - Works in IT **data engineering**, integrating **ERP, Workday, travel, HR data into Snowflake**
  - Builds **Tableau dashboards and automated data pipelines** for business decision-making
  - Transitioned from **internship → full-time** by demonstrating value through small data tools



## 💡 Lessons on Career Preparation
- **Personal Projects > Just Coursework**
  - Build one **deep project** you can talk about—more powerful than many shallow demos
- **Internships**: Ideally **by junior year**, but **personal projects + outreach** can substitute
- **Networking**: Reaching out to alumni on **LinkedIn works—alumni want to help**
- **Data Career Reality**: **Messy data, stakeholder communication, iteration, and revisions** matter more than “perfect code”



## 🤖 AI & Modern Workflow Changes
- **60–80% of analytics/engineering code** now written with **AI assistants (Claude, Copilot)**
- **“Vibe coding”** → prompting AI to generate logic flows instead of hand-coding everything
- Still requires **human review** → AI **amplifies analysts**, not replaces them
- **Data sensitivity & responsible AI use** are now core skills (Copilot within secure environment)



## 🧭 Mindset & Professional Growth
- **Don’t just execute requests — ask “why”** and **co-design solutions** with stakeholders
- **Avoid taking feedback personally** — debugging business logic is normal
- **Stay adaptable** — small teams + AI enable **startup-style speed**, even inside large companies




## ✅ Skills & Tools to Prioritize
- **Coding Fundamentals Matter** — Python, SQL, R (to understand and **correct AI-generated code**)
- **Streamlit / App Building** — both alumni mentioned it as a **direct advantage**
- **Data Pipeline Understanding** — Snowflake, ETL logic, API data ingestion
  - 💡 **API (Application Programming Interface):**  A structured way for one software or system to **communicate with another** — allowing programs to **request data or trigger actions** automatically, without using a manual interface (e.g., a browser).  
  - Example: The **Google Maps API** lets applications access location, routing, and distance data programmatically.
  
- **Dashboarding / Visualization** — Tableau or Shiny (used in **internship-to-job pipeline**)



## 🧠 Real Data Work = Beyond Clean CSVs
- **Messy, inconsistent corporate data is normal**
- Analysts must **reshape, clean, validate, and question data**
- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)** → users will question your output; **don’t take it personally**
- Communication = Core skill  



## 💬 Communication & Stakeholder Logic
- **Don’t just deliver what’s asked** — ask “What decision will this data support?”
- Stakeholders often **don’t know what they need**
- **You become the data advisor**, not just the “SQL person”
- **Work smart, not just hard** — clarify goals before coding dashboards



## 🧪 Personal Projects = Career Currency
- **Quality > Quantity** — one deep project beats five generic Kaggle plots
  - **Kaggle** — a platform for **data science competitions**, **datasets**, and **collaborative notebooks**.
- Jaehyung used a **self-tracked life project** to stand out in interviews
- **Use class projects as foundation**, then **extend them your own way**



## 🎓 Internships & Entry Points
- Common internship timing: **Summer before senior year**
- **No internship?** → personal projects + **LinkedIn outreach** still work, but having internship experience would be more beneficial
- Alumni emphasized: **“If a Geneseo student messages me, I feel responsible to reply.”**



## 🤖 How AI Actually Fits Into Data Jobs
- **80% of daily code** now AI-assisted
- “**Vibe coding**” = prompting AI to write working SQL/Python snippets
- **Human oversight remains essential**
- **Company policies differ** — many only allow **Copilot** or internal AI



## 🛡 Data Ethics & Security Awareness
- **Never paste confidential data** into public AI tools
- **Use secure AI (e.g., Microsoft Copilot)** within company systems
- **Understanding governance & privacy** = part of professional data practice



## 🧭 Career Mindset Recalibration
- **Big Tech ≠ only path** — small, AI-enabled startups thrive
- **Solo founders** can build functional apps with AI + data pipelines
- **“Best time in history to build something—don’t just consume.”**
