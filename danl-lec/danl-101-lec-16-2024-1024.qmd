## Grading

$$
\begin{align}
(\text{Total Percentage Grade}) =&\;\, 0.05\times(\text{Attendance}) \notag\\
&\,+\, 0.15\times(\text{Quiz & Class Participation})\notag\\ 
& \,+\, 0.15\times(\text{Homework})\notag\\  
&\,+\, 0.15\times(\text{Presentation})\notag\\
& \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Exam}).\notag
\end{align}
$$

## Grading


## Grading

- You are allowed up to 6 absences without penalty. 
  - Send me an email if you have standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).

- For each absence beyond the initial six, there will be a deduction of 1% from the Total Percentage Grade.

- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score. 
  - Each homework except for the homework with the lowest score accounts for 20% of the total homework score.


## Grading

$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Exam Score}) \\
=\, &\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$



- The total exam score is the maximum between 
  1. the simple average of the midterm exam score and the final exam score and
  2. the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam score and three-third weight on the final exam score:




## Grading

$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Midterm Exam}) \\
=\, &\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\right.,\notag\\ 
&\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$



- The total midterm exam score is the maximum between 
  1. the simple average of the midterm exam 1 score and the midterm exam 2 score and
  2. the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam 1 score and three-third weight on the midterm exam 2 score:

## Grading
- **Scenario 1**
  - Suppose your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$ is taken from:
$$
\begin{align}
&0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\\
&0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam})
\end{align}
$$
  - $(\text{Midterm Exam 1})$ will then account for only **6.25%** of your $\text{Total Exam Score}$.
  
## Grading
- **Scenario 2**
  - Suppose your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$ is taken from:
$$
\begin{align}
&0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\\
&0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam})
\end{align}
$$
  - $(\text{Midterm Exam 1})$ will then account for only **12.5%** of your $\text{Total Exam Score}$.

<!-- - **Data Visualization**: Convert data into meaningful graphics for better understanding of data. -->

<!-- - **Data Transformation**: Use key functions to filter observations, select variables, create new variables, and compute summaries. -->

<!-- - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Combine **descriptive statistics** (`skim()`), **visualization**, and **transformation** with curiosity and skepticism to explore and discover insights. -->

- *"The <u>narrative</u> is the key vehicle to convey insights, and the <u>visualizations</u> are important proof points to back up the narrative."* Ryan Fuller, Corporate Vice President, M365 Data Strategy at Microsoft

- **Data visualizations** are useful for showing "what" is happening in the data.
  - However, they often fall short in explaining the "why" and the "how" or providing the necessary context to uncover underlying reasons.

<!-- - **Data storytelling** links the **visualization** with a **narrative** to answer the "why" and the "how" question, and conveys **insights** to the audience to make data-driven decision. -->

-	**Data Storytelling**: Bridge the gap between **data** and **insights** by incorporating **descriptive statistics**, **visualization**, and **narration** within the appropriate **audience context** to effectively present your findings and drive data-informed decisions.

<!-- - 	•	Data Storytelling: Bridge the gap between data and insights by incorporating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and narration within the appropriate context—by aligning who your audience is, what you want them to understand or act upon, and how you present your findings—to drive data-informed decisions. -->

## Data Visualization

- **Data Visualization**: Convert data into meaningful graphics for better understanding of data.

- There are many different graphs and other types of visual displays of information.

- We will visualize: 
  - The **distribution** of a categorical/numeric variable
  - The **relationship** between two numeric variables
  - The **time trend** of a numeric variable


## Data Visualization
### Distribution

- **Distribution** refers to how the values of a variable are spread out or grouped within a data.frame.
  - It visualizes what type of **variation** occurs within a variable.


- **Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. 
  - We can see variation easily in real life; if we measure any numeric variable twice, we will be likely to get two different numbers.
  - Which values are the most common? Why?
    - The **mode** of a variable is the value that appears most frequently within the set of that variable's values.
  - Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?



## Data Visualization
### Distribution
- How you visualize the distribution of a variable depends on the type of variable: **categorical** or **numerical**.


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Categorical Variables**: Represent categories or groups (e.g., colors, departments, types)
  - Common visualizations:\
  **Bar charts**
  - <u>Example</u>: Distribution of favorite sports among students

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}  
- **Numerical Variables**: Represent numbers with meaningful values (e.g., age, income, temperature)
  - Common visualizations: **Histograms**, **Box plots**
  - <u>Example</u>: Distribution of heights in a class

:::

## Data Visualization
### Skewness

:::{.nonincremental}
- For a **histogram**, we can consider a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution---**skewness**.

       x = "Age",
       title = "How does the distribution of age varies by survival status\n in Titanic?") 
```



## Data Visualization
### Relationship
- From the plots with two numeric variables, we want to see **co-variation**, the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a **related** way. 

- What type of **co-variation** occurs between variables?
  - Are they **positively** associated?
  - Are they **negatively** associated?
  - Are there **no association** between them?

- Common visualizations: 
  - **Scatterplot**
  - **Fitted curves/line**

  labs(y = "Temperature",
       x = "Rainfall",
       title = "How is rainfall related to temperature?") 
```



## Data Visualization
### Time Trend

- A **time trend** plot, (also known as a *time series* plot), is used to visualize trends, patterns, and fluctuations in a variable over a specific time period. 
  - The x-axis typically represents time, while the y-axis represents the variable being measured. 

- We can check the overall direction in which the time-series variable are **moving—upwards**, **downwards**, or **staying relatively constant** over time.

- Common visualizations: 
  - **Line chart**
  - **Fitted Curve**

```





## Data Visualization
### Visualization Tools

- Many tools for visualizing data -- **Power BI**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, **Python**, **R**, and more

- **Power BI** and **Tableau** have **drag-and-drop interfaces**, making them accessible to users with little to no coding experience.

- In **R**, there are multiple packages for creating data visualizations—**ggplot2** is the most widely used one.
  - While we will briefly use **Power BI** and **Excel** for visualization, the primary visualization tool for this course will be **ggplot2** in **R**.
  
- Using **ggplot2** helps develop important coding and data skills, which are critical for more advanced data analytics work.
