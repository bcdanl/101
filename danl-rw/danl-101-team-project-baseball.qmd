# Sabermetrics

Baseball analysis underwent a significant transformation with Bill James’s pioneering work in the late 1970s. Through his publication, the Bill James Baseball Abstract, James challenged the reliance on traditional metrics like batting average, runs, and RBIs for hitters, and wins, ERA, and strikeouts for pitchers. Instead, he introduced innovative metrics such as runs created, Pythagorean win percentage, and game score. He called this analytical framework sabermetrics, named after the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR). While initially dismissed by traditionalists as secondary to the expertise of seasoned “baseball people,” James’s methods have become foundational in modern baseball. Today, every Major League Baseball team employs analytics experts who utilize advanced mathematics, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques to assemble competitive teams and make in-game decisions aimed at maximizing success.

For many, the 2011 movie Moneyball provides the most accessible introduction to sports analytics. The film recounts how the Oakland A’s used data-driven insights during their 2002 season, despite skepticism from traditional scouts who mocked Bill James’s ideas. Since that era, analytics have not replaced scouts but have become an essential complement, with every team now leveraging sophisticated data analyses alongside traditional evaluations.

# Baseball Metrics
## Historical Metrics
For over a century, baseball players were evaluated using a limited set of straightforward offensive and defensive statistics. However, advancements in computing and the introduction of sabermetrics revolutionized how player performance is assessed, giving rise to more nuanced and meaningful metrics.

### Offensive Statistics

| Statistic                   | Definition                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Batting Average**         | Hits divided by at-bats (Hits ÷ At-Bats)                                            |
| **Home Runs**               | Total number of home runs hit by a player                                           |
| **Runs Batted In (RBI)**    | Number of runs a player has batted in                                               |
| **Walks**                   | Number of times a batter reaches first base via four balls (also known as Base on Balls) |
| **On Base Percentage (OBP)**| Times on base (hits + walks + hit by pitch) divided by plate appearances            |
| **Runs Scored**             | Number of times a player crosses home plate to score a run                          |
| **Slugging Percentage (SLG)**| Total bases divided by at-bats (Total Bases ÷ At-Bats)                             |

### Defensive Statistics

| Statistic                    | Definition                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wins**                     | Credited to the pitcher who was pitching when his team took the lead for good       |
| **Innings Pitched**          | Total number of innings a pitcher has pitched                                       |
| **Earned Run Average (ERA)** | Average number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings pitched             |
| **Walks**                    | Number of batters a pitcher has allowed to reach first base via four balls          |
| **Strikeouts**               | Number of batters a pitcher has retired by striking them out                        |
| **WHIP**                     | Walks plus hits per inning pitched ((Walks + Hits) ÷ Innings Pitched)               |
| **Saves**                    | Credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain conditions |
| **Fielding Percentage**      | Percentage of times a defensive player handles the ball without making an error     |

## Runs Created
One of Bill James’s original metrics, Runs Created ($RC$), estimates the number of runs a player or team contributes to scoring. The formula is:

$$
RC = \frac{(H + BB + HBP) \times TB}{AB + BB + HBP}
$$

Where:

-	$H$ = Hits
-	$BB$ = Walks (Base on Balls)
-	$HBP$ = Hit by Pitch
-	$TB$ = Total Bases
-	$AB$ = At-Bats

This metric helps evaluate a player or team’s offensive value. For example, if considering adding a player to a team, comparing their runs created to other candidates provides a data-driven basis for decision-making.
