# Data
The following lists data frames about NBA for the 2022-23 season:

- `nba_games`: NBA Game Logs
- `nba_adv`: NBA Advanced Statistics
- `nba_ff`: NBA Four Factors---(1) Effective field goal percentage, (2) Turnovers committed per possession, (3) Offensive rebounding percentage, and (4) Free throw rate
- `nba_games_adv_ff`: Joined data.frame (Game Logs + Advanced Statistics + Four Factors)
  - `nba_games_adv_ff <- nba_games |> left_join(nba_adv) |> left_join(nba_ff)` by `c("team_id", "team_abbreviation", "game_id", "min")`

## Four Factors
The โfour factorsโ concept, developed by Dean Oliver and detailed in his book Basketball on Paper (available at basketballonpaper.com), outlines the key elements contributing to a teamโs success. Oliver originally assigned the following weights to these factors: shooting (40%), turnovers (25%), rebounding (20%), and free throws (15%). While the exact weighting is often debated, the importance of these four factors is widely recognized. They are critical not only for understanding a teamโs offensive efficiency but also for evaluating defensive performance (e.g., analyzing the opponentโs effective field goal percentage). The four factors are:

1.	Effective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%)
2.	Turnovers Committed per Possession
3.	Offensive Rebounding Percentage (ORP)
4.	Free Throw Rate (FTR)

### Effective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%)
Effective field goal percentage adjusts for the difference in value between two-point and three-point shots, giving three-pointers 50% more weight since they are worth 50% more points. The formula for EFG% is:

$$
EFG = \frac{fg2m + 1.5 \times fg3m}{fga}
$$
Where 

-	`fg2m`: Number of two-point field goals made
-	`fg3m`: Number of three-point field goals made
-	`fga`: Total field goals attempted

### Turnovers Committed per Possession
This metric measures how often a team turns the ball over relative to the number of possessions they have in a game. It highlights a teamโs ball-handling efficiency by considering turnovers (`tov`) in relation to total possessions (`poss`).

### Offensive Rebounding Percentage
Offensive rebounding percentage evaluates a teamโs ability to secure offensive rebounds compared to the total number of available offensive rebounds. The formula is:

$$
ORP = \frac{\text{Team Offensive Rebounds}}{\text{Team Offensive Rebounds + Opponent Offensive Rebounds}}
$$

### Free Throw Rate
Free throw rate measures how frequently a team attempts free throws compared to its total field goal attempts. The formula is:

$$
FTR = \frac{\text{Free Throw Attempts (fta)}}{\text{Field Goal Attempts (fga)}}
$$
