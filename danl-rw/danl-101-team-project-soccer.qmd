# Soccer Metrics

## Expected Goals and Assists

Soccer is renowned for its low-scoring nature. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, 172 goals were scored across 64 matches, averaging 2.68 goals per match—the highest average in World Cup history. Despite this, seven matches ended scoreless. The element of luck significantly influences goal scoring, and occasionally, players inadvertently score own goals. To better quantify scoring opportunities and player performance, the soccer analytics community has introduced **expected goals (xG)** as a metric to measure the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal.

Various models calculate xG, but fundamentally, it represents the probability of scoring from a specific spot on the field when a shot is taken. Factors considered in xG calculations include:

- **Body Part Used**: Whether the shot was taken with the head or foot.
- **Type of Play**: How the player received the ball (e.g., cross, set piece).
- **Goalkeeper Positioning**: The location and readiness of the goalkeeper.
- **Player Positioning**: Positions of teammates and opponents between the shooter and the goal.
- **Defensive Pressure**: How tightly defenders are marking the shooter.
- **Additional Situational Variables**: Other measurable factors that may affect shot success.

Since most shots do not result in goals, and many passes to shooters lead to missed opportunities, an analogous metric called **expected assists (xA)** evaluates the likelihood that a pass will lead to a goal. These metrics are often normalized per 90 minutes—denoted as xG per 90 or xA per 90—to allow fair comparisons between players with varying playing times.

Players consistently achieving high xG values are those who frequently position themselves advantageously on the field. Coaches and scouts use xG and xA metrics to assess whether a player's performance is influenced by luck over multiple games and to evaluate offensive skills beyond basic statistics.
