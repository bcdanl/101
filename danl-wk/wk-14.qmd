## 📊💡 Data Storytelling Project

Your team does **not** need to analyze every variable provided in the suggested data frames. Instead, carefully **select the variables that best support your story, argument, and analysis**.

To find an interesting story, you should:

- Explore your data using **descriptive statistics** (e.g., `skimr::skim()`)
- Apply **data transformations** such as filtering and counting
- Use **data visualizations** to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies
-	Draw on your **background knowledge** of the topic
- Treat the process as **iterative** — your understanding will evolve as you explore, refine, and visualize your data along with your story.

A strong data story emerges when your **analytical choices** (what you compute, transform, or visualize) clearly support your **narrative** and your **main insights**.

- [R Script for Data Storytelling Project (from the Guideline)](https://bcdanl.github.io/danl-rw/danl-101-team-project.html#submission){target="_blank"}
  - **Organization**: Use section headers (created with `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R`) and comments (`#`) to clearly label which parts of your code correspond to specific visualizations, transformations, and descriptive statistics. This will make your script easy to follow.
  - **Explanation**: Include comments to explain any parts of your code that use techniques not covered in the course. This should provide enough detail for others to understand the purpose and functionality of your code.
  - **Reproducibility**: Ensure your R script is complete and reproducible, meaning anyone who runs it should be able to replicate your results without needing additional information.
  - **Clarity**: Write clear and concise comments throughout your code to enhance readability and comprehension. Avoid overly complex or redundant code.
  - **Error Handling**: Make sure your code runs smoothly without errors.
