    "text": "Question 1. Assistance vs. Authorship\nWhich best defines “assistance vs. authorship” when using generative AI?\n\nAI represents assistance when it is any AI use; AI represents authorship when code runs\nAI represents assistance when it helps ideate/edit; AI represents authorship when it produces core content you submit as your own\nAI represents assistance when it is citations only; AI represents authorship when it is paraphrasing\nAI represents assistance when it is grammar; AI represents authorship when it is images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. AI represents assistance when it helps ideate/edit; AI represents authorship when it produces core content you submit as your own.\n💡 Explanation:\nAssistance means the human remains the main creator—AI contributes to brainstorming, editing, or formatting, but the final intellectual product originates from the human.\nAuthorship occurs when AI creates the central ideas, structure, or wording of a submission that the user passes off as their own.\n⚠️ Incorrect Options:\n- “Any AI use = assistance” → Too broad.\n- “Citations only / paraphrasing” → Misrepresents real AI use.\n- “Grammar vs. images” → Too narrow; authorship is about intellectual ownership."

create separate panels for each level of 'ad_status'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 18\nProvide a comment to describe how the relationship between (1) the natural log of sales and (2) the natural log of price varies by brand and ad_status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor interpretation purpose, let’s use the natural log, and switch axes:\n\nggplot(data = oj, \n       mapping = aes(x = log(price),\n                     y = log(sales),\n                     color = brand,\n                     fill = brand)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ad_status)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ads tend to change sales at all prices, they change price sensitivity, and they do both of these things in a brand-specific manner.\nWe see that being advertised always leads to more price sensitivity, particularly the demand for Minute Maid is much more price sensitive than when it is not.\nWhy does this happen?\n\nOne possible explanation is that advertisement increases the population of consumers who are considering your brand In particular, it can increase your market beyond brand loyalists, to include people who will be more price sensitive than those who reflexively buy your orange juice every week. Indeed, if you observe increased price sensitivity, it can be an indicator that your marketing efforts are expanding your consumer base.\n\nThis why ad campaigns should usually be accompanied by price cuts!\n\nThere is also an alternative explanation. Since the advertised products are often also discounted, it could be that the demand curve is nonlinear—at lower price points the average consumer is more price sensitive.\nThe truth is probably a combination of these effects."

    "text": "General Tips on Describing the Relationship Between Two Variables\n\nStart with determining whether the two variables have a positive association, a negative association, or no association.\n\n\nE.g., A negative slope in the fitted line indicates that sales decrease as the price increases, while a positive slope would indicate that sales increase with price. A zero slope means that there is no relationship between sales and price; changes in price do not affect sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a question asks you to describe how the relationship varies by another variable, examine both the direction of the slope (negative, positive, or none) from the fitted line and the steepness of the slope (steep or shallow).\n\n\nThe slope of the fitted straight line is the rate at which the “y” variable (like grades) changes as the “x” variable (like study hours) changes. In simple terms, it shows how much one thing goes up or down when the other thing changes.\nFor example, a comment such as, “The plot shows a negative relationship between sales and price” does not address how the relationship differs by brand\n\n\nBe specific.\n\n\nFor example, a comment such as, “The plot illustrates how the relationship between the natural log of sales and the natural log of price varies across brands, with each brand showing a unique regression line and scatter pattern,” simply rephrases the question, and does not actually answer it at all.\n\n\nThe focus is on the relationship, not the distribution.\n\n\nWhile adding a comment on the distribution of a single variable can be helpful, the question is primarily about the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\nAdd Narration if Available: If possible, connect the relationship to real-world phenomena and/or your idea that could help explain it, adding insight into what is happening."

    "text": "General Tips on Describing the Time Trend of a Variable\n\nStart with Identifying the Overall Trend: Look for the general direction of the trend over time.\n\n\nIs it moving upward, downward, or remaining relatively constant?\nBe specific: A comment like “The trend shows the evolution of hitting techniques in the MLB over time” simply rephrases the question, and does not actually answer it at all.\n\n\nNote Patterns and Cycles: Identify any repeating patterns, such as seasonal fluctuations (e.g., monthly or quarterly changes) or long-term cycles. These patterns can indicate regular influences on the variable over time.\nHighlight Any Significant Fluctuations: Describe any sharp increases, decreases, or irregular spikes in the data.\nAdd Narration if Available: If possible, connect trends to real-world events or factors and/or your idea that could explain them, helping to interpret why the trend behaves a certain way over time."

Additional absences may affect your grade unless they are formally excused. If you must miss class for a standard excused reason (e.g., illness, family emergency, transportation issues), please notify me at bchoe@geneseo.edu so the absence can be recorded appropriately.\nRegular attendance is expected, as discussions, activities, and projects are central to your learning. If you anticipate challenges that may affect your attendance, please reach out—I am happy to work with you to help you stay on track.\n\n\nGrading\n\nTotal Percentage Grade\n\nAttendance: 5%\n\nQuizzes & Participation: 5%\n\nHomework: 20% (single lowest homework score dropped)\n\nTeam Project: 20%\n\nExams: 50% \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\quad\\\\\n&\\text{(Total Percentage Score)} \\\\\n= &\\quad\\; 0.05 \\times \\text{(Attendance)} \\\\\n&+ 0.05 \\times \\text{(Quiz \\& Participation)}\\\\\n&+ 0.20 \\times \\text{(Homework)}\\\\\n&+ 0.20 \\times \\text{(Team Project)}\\\\\n&+ 0.50 \\times \\text{(Exams)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nExam Score Calculations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\quad(\\text{Midterm Exam Score})\\\\\n&= \\max\\left\\{0.50 \\times \\text{(Midterm 1 Score)} + 0.50 \\times \\text{(Midterm 2 Score)},\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\quad\\;\\;\\,\\left.0.33 \\times \\text{(Midterm 1 Score)} + 0.67 \\times \\text{(Midterm 2 Score)}\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe Midterm Exam Score will be the higher of the following two calculations:\n\nThe simple average of Midterm Exam 1 and Midterm Exam 2\nThe weighted average, with one-third weight on Midterm Exam 1 and two-thirds weight on Midterm Exam 2\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\quad(\\text{Total Exam Score})\\\\\n&= \\max\\left\\{0.50 \\times \\text{(Midterm Exam Score)} + 0.50 \\times \\text{(Final Exam Score)},\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\quad\\;\\;\\,\\left.0.25 \\times \\text{(Midterm Exam Score)} + 0.75 \\times \\text{(Final Exam Score)}\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe Total Exam Score will be the higher of the following two calculations:\n\nThe simple average of Midterm Exam and Final Exam\nThe weighted average, with one-fourth weight on Midterm Exam and three-forth weight on Final Exam.\n\nTeam Project Score \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\quad\\text{(Team Project Score)}\\\\\n&= 0.05 \\times \\text{(Peer Evaluation)} + 0.95 \\times \\text{(Instructor Evaluation)}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLetter Grade Scale\nTotal percentage scores are converted to letter grades according to the following ranges:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n100 &≥ A ≥ 93 &gt; A− ≥ 90\\\\\n90 &&gt; B+ ≥ 87 &gt; B ≥ 83 &gt; B− ≥ 80\\\\\n80 &&gt; C+ ≥ 77 &gt; C ≥ 73 &gt; C− ≥ 70\\\\\n70 &&gt; D ≥ 60 &gt; E\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nPolicies\n\nMake-up Exams\nMake-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University. For religious obligations, notify the instructor by email at least two weeks in advance to set an alternative time. A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nUnless AI tools are explicitly permitted for homework or in-class quizzes, you must complete your work independently. Using tools like ChatGPT for any aspect of coursework is a form of academic dishonesty and undermines the development of your own skills. If you have questions, please ask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📝 If you use AI for a particular assignment and/or project, you must also:\n\n📝 You must document which AI platforms and tools you used.\n📤 You must include your prompts and AI outputs with your assignment submission.\n🧠 You must include a reflection on your AI usage and learning process.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Integrity and Plagiarism\nAll homework assignments and exams must be your original work. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Examples include:\n\nRepresenting the work, thoughts, or ideas of another person as your own\n\nAllowing others to represent your work, thoughts, or ideas as theirs\n\nBeing complicit in academic dishonesty by suspecting or knowing of it and not taking action\n\nSee: Academic Dishonesty Policy and Procedures and Plagiarism Tutorial Brightspace Link\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSUNY Geneseo is dedicated to providing an equitable and inclusive educational experience for all students. The Office of Accessibility (OAS) will coordinate reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities to ensure equal access to academic programs, activities, and services offered by SUNY Geneseo.\nStudents with approved accommodations may submit a semester request to renew their academic accommodations. More information on the process for requesting academic accommodations is on the OAS website.\nQuestions? Contact the OAS by email, phone, or in-person:\nOffice of Accessibility Services\nErwin Hall 22\n585-245-5112\naccess@geneseo.edu\n\n\nPublic Health and Class Attendance\nIf you are experiencing symptoms associated with COVID on a day that class meets in-person, do not attend. Communicate proactively about absences and contact the Dean of Students if you expect to be out for an extended period.\n\n\nReligious Observations and Class Attendance\nNew York State Education Law 224-a stipulates that “any student in an institution of higher education who is unable, because of [their] religious beliefs, to attend classes on a particular day or days shall, because of such absence on the particular day or days, be excused from any examination or any study or work requirements” (see General Classroom Policies for more information). SUNY Geneseo has a commitment to inclusion and belonging, and I want to stress my respect for the diverse identities and faith traditions of students in my class. If you anticipate an absence due to religious observations, please contact me as soon as possible in advance to discuss your needs and arrange make up plans. The New York State Department of Civil Service maintains a calendar of major religious observations.\n\n\nMilitary Obligations and Class Attendance\nFederal and New York State law requires institutions of higher education to provide an excused leave of absence from classes without penalty to students enrolled in the National Guard or armed forces reserves who are called to active duty. If you are called to active military duty and need to miss classes, please let me know and consult as soon as possible with the Dean of Students.\n\n\nBias-Related Incidents\n\n“We are here to listen, to learn, to teach, to debate, to change, to grow. We should all be safe to pursue these goals at SUNY Geneseo while being who we are. Together, we commit ourselves to pluralism, cultivating a community that respects difference and promotes a sense of inclusion and belonging.”\n\nAs this excerpt from our Community Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion states, here at SUNY Geneseo, we want to provide a space where everyone feels welcome to learn and grow in their identities as well as in their role as students, faculty, and staff. If in the unfortunate instance you witness or experience an incident of bias, we encourage you to reach out to the Chief Diversity Officer, Director of Multicultural Affairs, and/or our University Police Department. You may also choose to report it through the bias-related incident reporting form. In trying to create an environment that facilitates growth through diverse thoughts and ideas, reporting incidents of bias - including threats, vandalism, and microaggressive behaviors - can help bring a better understanding of our campus climate as well as provide opportunities for learning and restoring harm.\n\n\n\nPersonal Health, Well-being, and Basic Needs\n\nWell-Being\nPrioritizing well-being can support the achievement of academic goals and alleviate stress. Eating nutritious foods, getting enough sleep, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, maintaining healthy relationships, and building in time to relax all help promote a healthy lifestyle and general well-being. Your health and wellbeing are foundational to your ability to learn, and if you find that you are feeling unwell (physically or mentally) and it is impacting your ability to complete your coursework, please reach out. In a similar way, I will occasionally ask for some patience and flexibility on your part.\nIf I am slow responding to an email, if I take some time to grade an assignment, or if I am a bit late posting course materials, please be patient (and feel free to send me a ‘nudge’; I will not be offended). You will never suffer any disadvantage in the course because of delays on my part. Remember that we are all in this together.\n\n\nBasic Needs Statement\nIn order to foster a sense of belonging and connection, a state of financial, mental, emotional and physical stability must be achieved. If you are facing food insecurity, displacement, an emergency, crisis, or health-related or medical expense, you are not alone. Concerns about academic performance, health situations, family health and wellness (including the loss of a loved one), interpersonal relationships and commitments, and other factors can contribute to stress. Students are strongly encouraged to communicate their needs to faculty and staff and seek support if they are experiencing unmanageable stress or are having difficulties with daily functioning. The Dean of Students (585-245-5706) can assist and provide direction to appropriate campus resources. For more information, visit the Dean of Students Office website.\n\n\nMental Health\nAs a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can impact your mental health and thus impact your learning; common examples include increased anxiety, shifts in mood, strained relationships, difficulties related to substance use, trouble concentrating, and lack of motivation, among many others. These experiences may reduce your ability to participate fully in daily activities and affect your academic performance.\nSUNY Geneseo offers free, confidential counseling for students through Student Health and Counseling, and seeking support for your mental health can be key to your success at college. You can learn more about the various mental health services available on campus online. To request a counseling appointment, please complete the online form.\n\n\nGuidelines for Attendance and Public Health\nSUNY Geneseo is a residential liberal arts college where we all learn together in a shared space. This classroom community is vital for engaging in discussions, solving problems, and answering questions together. Learning is an active process, and it requires engagement - on my part and yours. I promise to create an interactive and collaborative classroom space, and in return I expect you to attend and engage in the activities.\nIt’s possible that some of you may get sick over the course of the semester. Because we want you to be successful and because we value your contribution to the course, we expect you to prioritize attendance. If you are not feeling well and your symptoms do not allow you to attend class, stay home (except to go to the health center), rest, and take care of yourself. You can find more guidelines from the Center for Disease Control for precautions when sick which cover flu, COVID, and other illnesses.\nI expect you to communicate with me directly about your absences. I can support you to keep up with class if you are out for an illness, but I need you to take responsibility for being transparent and clear in letting me know when you are out and why. Although I can work with you on keeping up, you may miss some course content and extended absences may impact your ability to realize your full potential in this class. For extended absences (i.e., more than a couple of days of classes), you should contact the Dean of Students who can assist with reaching out to your faculty.\n\n\nFood Security for SUNY Geneseo Students\nSUNY Geneseo is committed to supporting students who are experiencing food insecurity. If you’re unfamiliar with the phrase “food insecurity,” you can learn more at the following link on Feeding America’s website: Understanding Food Insecurity.\nKnights’ Harvest Pantry, our on-campus food pantry, is a collaborative initiative supported by Campus Auxiliary Services (CAS) and facilitated by trained student volunteers. The program is advised by the Assistant Director of Student Volunteerism and Community Engagement in partnership with the Geneseo Opportunities for Leadership Development (GOLD) program.\nStudents who are in need can confidentially request a bag of food and basic hygiene supplies through our website. These bags typically include non-perishable items and, when available, fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products. Pickups take place at the GOLD Leadership Center in MacVittie College Union, Room 114.\nWe are committed to protecting student privacy and promoting dignity, while also working to destigmatize food insecurity on our campus. If Knights’ Harvest Pantry does not fully meet your needs or if you’d prefer to discuss your situation privately, please reach out to Cheyenne DeMarco, Assistant Director of Student Volunteerism and Community Engagement, at cdemarco@geneseo.edu for a one-on-one consultation.\nPlease note that Knights’ Harvest Pantry is closed during official SUNY breaks, including Fall Break, Winter Intersession, Spring Break, and summer between semesters. During these times, students are encouraged to access the Geneseo-Groveland Emergency Food Pantry, located at 31 Center Street, Geneseo, NY 14454. For updates on pantry hours, events, and additional support opportunities, follow us on Instagram or Facebook: @knightsharvestgeneseo. For questions or support, contact Cheyenne DeMarco at cdemarco@geneseo.edu or (585) 245-5893.\n\n\nEmergency Funding\nThe college has three sources of emergency funding for students experiencing short-term financial crises. The Camiolo Student Emergency Loan Fund (SELF) provides short-term loans to students for situations both temporary and beyond their control. The SELF was established with the expectation that students who use the fund seek to “pay it forward” as soon as they are able by contributing to the fund so other students can be helped, too. While there is not a legal obligation, the donors hope that student loan recipients respect and honor the value of community and helping others in their time of crisis. The One Knight Student Aid Emergency Fund assists Geneseo students who are facing financial emergencies mainly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fund offers grants (one-time award) depending on a student’s documented financial need. For those students expecting a refund from financial aid, a Temple Hill loan of up to $500 can be offered prior to the approved loan dispersal. If you are experiencing financial hardship, please contact the Dean of Students (585-245-5706), who can assist and provide direction to appropriate campus resources.\n\n\n\nSUNY Geneseo’s Commitments, Mission and Values\nSUNY Geneseo has several core documents that articulate our shared commitments and learning objectives. These include:\n\nSUNY Geneseo Mission, Vision and Values\nCommunity Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nSustainability as a Core Value\nGeneseo Learning Outcomes for Baccalaureate Education\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe syllabus may be subject to change during the semester. If it is changed, you will be notified via email and Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Which tool is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that you can install on your computer to develop programs primarily using the R programming language?\n\nPosit Cloud\nGoogle Colab\nJupyter Notebook\nRStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nExplanation: RStudio (now under Posit) is a dedicated desktop IDE for R that provides a console, script editor, package management, plotting, and a full debugging workflow. Posit Cloud and Google Colab are browser-based environments (great for portability, but not desktop IDEs), and Jupyter Notebook is a notebook interface mainly used with Python (though R kernels exist, it is not the primary R IDE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich version-control tool allows users to track, compare, and merge code changes?\n\nGitHub\nGit\nR\nStack Overflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb\nExplanation: Git is the version-control system that performs the actual tracking of changes, branching, merging, and diffing. GitHub is a hosting platform built around Git repositories (remote collaboration, pull requests, issues). R is a programming language, and Stack Overflow is a Q&A site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key distinction between Traditional Programming and Machine Learning (ML) in the context of image recognition (like for a cat) is that ML:\n\nRequires programmers to explicitly define rules for “cat” features (pointy ears, whiskers).\nIs less effective at finding hidden patterns in pixels than traditional methods.\nLearns the patterns from thousands of labeled cat/not-cat pictures rather than relying on fixed, explicit rules.\nCan be used for image recognition and but not for classification tasks like spam detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nExplanation: In ML, models discover patterns from labeled data (e.g., many cat vs. not-cat images) rather than relying on hand-crafted rules. Traditional programming would require explicit feature rules (option a). ML often outperforms manual rules on high-dimensional pattern recognition (contradicting b) and is widely used for both image recognition and many other classification tasks such as spam detection (contradicting d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the key contribution of Moneyball to sports analytics?\n\nIt created new baseball rules for team selection.\nIt replaced human coaches with AI models.\nIt popularized data-driven decision-making in sports management.\nIt eliminated the use of scouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nExplanation: Moneyball demonstrated that rigorous statistical analysis (e.g., on-base percentage) could uncover undervalued players and improve roster-building decisions. It did not change MLB rules, eliminate scouts, or replace coaches with AI; instead, it shifted culture toward evidence-based decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich statement best captures the distinctive role of Business Intelligence (BI) compared to other data-driven systems?\n\nBI focuses on automating decisions through artificial intelligence and predictive modeling.\nBI emphasizes descriptive and diagnostic insights that help managers understand why outcomes occurred.\nBI replaces human judgment by forecasting business outcomes using statistical learning.\nBI primarily stores large volumes of unprocessed data for future retrieval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb\nExplanation: BI primarily supports descriptive and diagnostic analytics (dashboards, reporting, drill-downs) to help stakeholders understand what happened and why. Predictive/automated decision-making is more aligned with data science and ML (contradicting a and c), and large-scale raw data storage is the role of data lakes/warehouses (contradicting d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat distinguishes Deep Learning from general Machine Learning?\n\nDeep learning is the overarching field of AI, while machine learning is just a sub-area.\nDeep learning is an advanced machine learning methodology that is uniquely suited for complex tasks and primarily relies on artificial neural networks.\nDeep learning models are capable of making predictions or generating outputs, while machine learning models are not.\nDeep learning is the practice of designing structured inputs to guide generative AI systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb\nExplanation: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layer (deep) neural networks, often excelling on unstructured data (images, audio, text). ML as a whole includes many methods (decision trees, regression models). Options a and c invert relationships, and d describes prompt engineering, not deep learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of a Large Language Model (LLM), what is the function of Pre-training?\n\nTo specialize the model for a specific task like medical Q&A or legal summarization.\nTo have humans rank or score model answers to align them with preferences.\nTo read a vast amount of text to learn general language patterns, resulting in a foundation model with broad knowledge.\nTo reduce model biases by explicitly removing skewed data from the training corpus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nExplanation: Pre-training exposes the model to large corpora so it learns broad statistical patterns of language (syntax, semantics, world knowledge). Fine-tuning specializes models for specific tasks (a), RLHF uses human preference signals (b), and while data curation can address some biases (d), that is not the core function of pre-training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following best describes an “embedding” in the context of GPT models?\n\nA single number representing a word’s position in a sentence.\nA long list of numbers that captures a word’s meaning and allows words with similar meanings to have similar numerical representations.\nThe final text output generated by the decoder.\nA specific part of the training dataset used for fine-tuning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb\nExplanation: An embedding is a dense vector representation capturing semantic relationships among tokens; similar meanings tend to have nearby vectors. It is not a single scalar (a), not the model’s generated text (c), and not a dataset subset (d)."

    "text": "A key distinction between Traditional Programming and Machine Learning (ML) in the context of image recognition (like for a cat) is that ML:\n\nRequires programmers to explicitly define rules for “cat” features (pointy ears, whiskers).\nIs less effective at finding hidden patterns in pixels than traditional methods.\nLearns the patterns from thousands of labeled cat/not-cat pictures rather than relying on fixed, explicit rules.\nCan be used for image recognition and but not for classification tasks like spam detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nExplanation: In ML, models discover patterns from labeled data (e.g., many cat vs. not-cat images) rather than relying on hand-crafted rules. Traditional programming would require explicit feature rules (option a). ML often outperforms manual rules on high-dimensional pattern recognition (contradicting b) and is widely used for both image recognition and many other classification tasks such as spam detection (contradicting d)."

    "text": "Question 29\nWhy is the median often preferred over the mean as a measure of central tendency when a dataset contains outliers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median is less sensitive to extreme values because it depends only on the middle position in an ordered dataset, not on the magnitude of all values. Outliers can pull the mean sharply in one direction, distorting the central tendency and giving a misleading picture of the “typical” value. In skewed distributions or datasets with extreme highs/lows, the median provides a more robust and representative summary. For this reason, analysts often use the median for income, housing price, or other economic data known to contain large outliers."

    "text": "Question 30\n\nDefine AI Alignment and explain why it is hard, referencing the failure mode of a “single-objective optimizer.”\nAnalyze why companies alone and governments alone cannot solve the alignment challenge, citing at least two reasons for each, and explain what is needed for an effective solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Alignment refers to the challenge of ensuring that powerful AI systems reliably act according to human values, ethical norms, and societal goals. It is difficult because advanced AI systems can optimize objectives in ways that technically satisfy a metric but violate human intent—this is the “single-objective optimizer” failure mode. When a model pushes one goal to an extreme without broader context or value constraints, it can generate harmful or unintended outcomes even while maximizing its target metric.\nWhy companies alone cannot solve it:\n\nCompanies face pressure to deploy quickly for competitive advantage, which may lead to cutting corners on long-term safety and value alignment.\nCorporate profit incentives do not necessarily align with broader public welfare and ethical standards, especially in global contexts beyond their direct accountability.\n\nWhy governments alone cannot solve it:\n\nGovernments often lack the technical expertise and agility to regulate fast-moving AI developments effectively.\nGlobal AI deployment crosses jurisdictions, and national policies cannot fully enforce alignment across private-sector labs or international competitors without global coordination.\n\nWhat is needed:\nAn effective solution requires collaboration between researchers, companies, governments, and international institutions. This includes shared safety standards, transparent evaluation protocols, incentive structures that reward responsible development, and oversight mechanisms that span beyond national or corporate boundaries."

Explain why the IQR is often preferred over the SD when summarizing the dispersion of a dataset that contains outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIQR vs SD\nInterquartile Range (IQR):\nThe IQR is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\nStandard Deviation (SD):\nThe SD measures the average distance of each data point from the mean. It reflects overall variability, including extreme values.\nWhy IQR is preferred with outliers:\n\nSD is sensitive to outliers because squaring deviations magnifies extreme values.\n\nIQR is robust—it ignores the lowest 25% and highest 25% of data, making it less influenced by extreme or skewed values.\n\nFor skewed distributions or datasets with outliers, IQR provides a more stable summary of spread."

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nMollick, Ethan. Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI, Penguin Publishing Group, 2024.\n\nRead: Introduction, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2\n\n\n\n\nTransformers\nTransformers are a type of neural network architecture that transforms or changes an input sequence into an output sequence. They do this by learning context and tracking relationships between sequence components. For example, consider this input sequence: “What is the color of the sky?” The transformer model uses an internal mathematical representation that identifies the relevancy and relationship between the words color, sky, and blue. It uses that knowledge to generate the output: “The sky is blue.”\n\nHow do transformers work?\nNeural networks have been the leading method in various AI tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing (NLP) since the early 2000s. They consist of layers of interconnected computing nodes, or neurons, that mimic the human brain and work together to solve complex problems.\nTraditional neural networks that deal with data sequences often use an encoder/decoder architecture pattern. The encoder reads and processes the entire input data sequence, such as an English sentence, and transforms it into a compact mathematical representation. This representation is a summary that captures the essence of the input. Then, the decoder takes this summary and, step by step, generates the output sequence, which could be the same sentence translated into French.\nThis process happens sequentially, which means that it has to process each word or part of the data one after the other. The process is slow and can lose some finer details over long distances.\n\n\nAttention mechanism\nTransformer models modify this process by incorporating something called a attention mechanism. Instead of processing data in order, the mechanism enables the model to look at different parts of the sequence all at once and determine which parts are most important.\nImagine that you’re in a busy room and trying to listen to someone talk. Your brain automatically focuses on their voice while tuning out less important noises. Attention enables the model do something similar: it pays more attention to the relevant bits of information and combines them to make better output predictions. This mechanism makes transformers more efficient, enabling them to be trained on larger datasets. It’s also more effective, especially when dealing with long pieces of text where context from far back might influence the meaning of what’s coming next.\n\n\nReference\n\nAWS - What are Transformers in Artificial Intelligence? \n\n⚠️ Note: These excerpts from the above article are shared under fair use for educational purposes to support your learning.\n\n\n\nGPT\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformers, commonly known as GPT, are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture and is a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. GPT models give applications the ability to create human-like text and content (images, music, and more), and answer questions in a conversational manner. Organizations across industries are using GPT models and generative AI for Q&A bots, text summarization, content generation, and search.\n\nHow does GPT work?\nThe GPT models are transformer neural networks. The transformer neural network architecture uses attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the input text during each processing step. A transformer model captures more context and improves performance on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It has two main modules, which we explain next.\n\nEncoder\n\nBefore a transformer can make sense of language, words must be turned into numbers. This is done with embeddings, which are long lists of numbers that capture meaning. Words with similar meanings, like sea and ocean, end up with embeddings that look alike, while very different words like cat are far apart. In real models, these vectors often have hundreds of numbers, not just a few. For example, if you only described a fruit with three traits such as color, size, and sweetness, you would get a rough idea. But if you described it with 300 traits such as texture, smell, taste, and shape, you would have a much richer description. That is why embeddings need so many numbers. But meaning alone is not enough. Transformers read all words in parallel, so they also need positional encoding to know order. Without it, the sentences “The cat chased the dog” and “The dog chased the cat” would look the same. Positional encoding is like giving each word a seat number in a row so the model knows where the word sits in the sentence.\nOnce words have both meaning from embeddings and order from positional encoding, the attention mechanism can actually do its job: deciding which words matter most to each other in context. Without embeddings, the model would just see words as IDs with no sense of meaning. Without positional encoding, it would treat the words as if they were a bag of tokens, with no sense of order. Together, embeddings and positions give attention the raw material it needs to calculate relationships. For example, in the question “What is the color of the sea?”, the token color should pay strong attention to sea, not to what. This process creates context-aware representations, where every word is updated to reflect its role in the sentence. That is why the model can then generate the correct answer “The sea is blue.” For example, think of listening to someone in a noisy room. Your ears (embeddings) tell you what the sounds mean, and your sense of direction (positional encoding) tells you where they are coming from. Only then can your focus (attention) tune in to the important voice and ignore the rest. In the same way, embeddings give meaning, positional encoding gives order, and attention ties them together so the transformer can make sense of language.\n\n\nDecoder\nThe decoder produces the output one token at a time. With attention, it focuses on the most relevant parts of what it has already seen. At each step, it scores many possible next tokens and chooses the most likely one, repeating this process until the answer is complete.\n\n\n\nHow was GPT-3 trained?\nIn a published research paper, researchers described generative pretraining as the ability to train language models with unlabeled data and achieve accurate prediction. The first GPT model, GPT-1, was developed in 2018. GPT-4 was introduced in March 2023 as a successor to GPT-3.\nGPT-3 was trained with over 175 billion parameters or weights. Engineers trained it on over 45 terabytes of data from sources like web texts, Common Crawl, books, and Wikipedia. Prior to training, the average quality of the datasets was improved as the model matured from version 1 to version 3.\nGPT-3 trained in a semi-supervised mode. First, machine learning engineers fed the deep learning model with the unlabeled training data. GPT-3 would understand the sentences, break them down, and reconstruct them into new sentences. In unsupervised training, GPT-3 attempted to produce accurate and realistic results by itself. Then, machine learning engineers would fine-tune the results in supervised training, a process known as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).\nYou can use the GPT models without any further training, or you can customize them with a few examples for a particular task.\n\n\nReference\n\nAWS - What is GPT\n\n⚠️ Note: These excerpts from the above article are shared under fair use for educational purposes to support your learning.\n\n\n\nRLHF\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a machine learning (ML) technique that uses human feedback to optimize ML models to self-learn more efficiently. Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques train software to make decisions that maximize rewards, making their outcomes more accurate. RLHF incorporates human feedback in the rewards function, so the ML model can perform tasks more aligned with human goals, wants, and needs. RLHF is used throughout generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) applications, including in large language models (LLM).\n\nWhy is RLHF important?\nThe applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are broad-ranging, from self-driving cars to natural language processing (NLP), stock market predictors, and retail personalization services. No matter the given application, the goal of AI is ultimately to mimic human responses, behaviors, and decision-making. The ML model must encode human input as training data so that the AI mimics humans more closely when completing complex tasks.\nRLHF is a specific technique that is used in training AI systems to appear more human, alongside other techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning. First, the model’s responses are compared to the responses of a human. Then a human assesses the quality of different responses from the machine, scoring which responses sound more human. The score can be based on innately human qualities, such as friendliness, the right degree of contextualization, and mood.\nRLHF is prominent in natural language understanding, but it’s also used across other generative AI applications.\n\nEnhances AI performance\nRLHF makes the ML model more accurate. Models can be trained on pregenerated human data, but having additional human feedback loops significantly enhances model performance compared to its initial state.\nFor example, when text is translated from one language to another, a model might produce text that’s technically correct but sounds unnatural to the reader. A professional translator can first perform the translation, with the machine-generated translation scored against it, and then a series of machine-generated translations can be scored for quality. The addition of further training to the model makes it better at producing natural-sounding translations.\n\n\nIntroduces complex training parameters\nIn some instances in generative AI, it can be difficult to accurately train the model for certain parameters. For example, how do you define the mood of a piece of music? There might be technical parameters such as key and tempo that indicate a certain mood, but a musical piece’s spirit is more subjective and less well defined than just a series of technicalities. Instead, you can provide human guidance where composers create moody pieces, and then you can label machine-generated pieces according to their level of moodiness. This enables a machine to learn these parameters much more quickly.\n\n\nEnhances user satisfaction\nAlthough an ML model can be accurate, it might not appear human. RL is needed to guide the model toward the best, most engaging response for human users.\nFor example, if you asked a chatbot what the weather is like outside, it might respond, “It’s 30 degrees Celsius with clouds and high humidity,” or it might respond, “The temperature is around 30 degrees at the moment. It’s cloudy out and humid, so the air might seem thicker!” Although both responses say the same thing, the second response sounds more natural and provides more context.\nAs human users rate which model responses they prefer, you can use RLHF for collecting human feedback and improving your model to best serve real people.\n\n\n\nReference\n\nAWS - What is RLHF?\n\n⚠️ Note: These excerpts from the above article are shared under fair use for educational purposes to support your learning."

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nMachine Learning\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that performs data analysis tasks without explicit instructions. Machine learning technology can process large quantities of historical data, identify patterns, and predict new relationships between previously unknown data. You can perform classification and prediction tasks on documents, images, numbers, and other data types.\nFor example, a financial organization could train a machine learning system to classify fraudulent and genuine transactions. The system identifies patterns in known data to accurately guess or predict whether a new transaction is genuine.\n\n\nHow does machine learning work?\nThe central idea behind machine learning is an existing mathematical relationship between any input and output data combination. The machine learning model does not know this relationship in advance but can guess if sufficient examples of input-output data sets are given. This means every machine learning algorithm is built around a modifiable math function. The underlying principle can be understood like this:\nWe ‘train’ the algorithm by giving it the following input/output (i,o) combinations – (2,10), (5,19), and (9,31)\nThe algorithm computes the relationship between input and output to be: o=3*i+4\nWe then give it input 7 and ask it to predict the output. It can automatically determine the output as 25.\nWhile this is a basic understanding, machine learning focuses on the principle that computer systems can mathematically link all complex data points as long as they have sufficient data and computing power to process. Therefore, the accuracy of the output is directly co-relational to the magnitude of the input given. Machine learning phases are given below.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of machine learning?\nData is the critical driving force behind business decision-making. Modern organizations generate data from thousands of sources, including smart sensors, customer portals, social media, and application logs. Machine learning automates and optimizes the process of data collection, classification, and analysis. Businesses can drive growth, unlock new revenue streams, and solve challenging problems faster.\nBenefits of machine learning include:\n\nEnhanced decision making\n\nMachine learning systems can process and analyze massive data volumes quickly and accurately. They can identify unforeseen patterns in dynamic and complex data in real time. Organizations can make data-driven decisions at runtime and respond more effectively to changing conditions. They can optimize operations and mitigate risks with confidence.\n\nAutomation of routine tasks\n\nMachine learning algorithms can filter, sort, and classify data without human intervention. They can summarize reports, scan documents, transcribe audio, and tag content—tasks that are tedious and time-consuming for humans to perform. Automating routine and repetitive tasks leads to substantial productivity gains and cost reductions. You also get improved accuracy and efficiency.\n\nImproved customer experiences\n\nMachine learning transforms customer experiences through personalization. For example, retailers recommend products to customers based on previous purchases, browsing history, and search patterns. Streaming services customize viewing recommendations in the entertainment industry. The personalized approach increases customer retention and brand loyalty.\n\nProactive resource management\n\nOrganizations use machine learning to forecast trends and behaviors with high precision. For example, predictive analytics can anticipate inventory needs and optimize stock levels to reduce overhead costs. Predictive insights are crucial for planning and resource allocation, making organizations more proactive rather than reactive.\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nA distinctive advantage of machine learning is its ability to improve as it processes more data. Machine learning systems adapt and learn from new data. They adjust and enhance their performance to remain practical and relevant over time.\n\n\nReference\n\nAWS - What is Machine Learning?\n\n⚠️ Note: These excerpts from the above article are shared under fair use for educational purposes to support your learning."

    "text": "Framing: When and how to pair humans with GenAI\n\n\n\nExhibit 1 – When and How to Pair Humans and GenAI\n\n\nUp/down = how strong the human is on a task. Left/right = how strong the AI is on that task.\nWhat it means for you.\n\nTop-right (use AI confidently): You + AI are strong → you go faster and keep quality high (great for drafting, refactoring, and summarizing work you already understand).\nTop-left (don’t over-rely): You’re strong, AI is weak → trust your own method; use AI for small ideas, not final answers.\nBottom-right (supervise + learn): AI is strong, you’re new → AI can expand your capabilities today, but you must check its work and learn the basics.\nBottom-left (learn first): Neither is strong → start with a mini-lesson, example, or office hours before delegating to AI.\n\n\nAs access to AI tools grows—through free versions, student-friendly platforms, and training programs offered by schools or employers—more students will find themselves in the bottom-right quadrant of the human–AI map. In this position, the AI is strong at a task, while the human is still developing skills. This means AI can help you perform at a higher level earlier than you could on your own, letting you complete assignments, projects, or coding tasks that might otherwise feel out of reach. But this shortcut also comes with a trap: you might lean too heavily on AI without actually understanding what’s happening.\nYour responsibility is to move up the human-skill axis, which means turning AI-assisted performance into genuine knowledge and ability. That requires doing the hard work of learning—checking outputs manually, practicing problem-solving without AI, and reflecting on why a solution works. In other words, use AI as a springboard to support your growth, while also making sure you understand the underlying concepts yourself. The real value comes from combining AI-assisted performance with your own learning. As you continue to practice and reflect, you’ll gradually build the kind of durable expertise that helps on exams, in internships, and later in your career."

    "text": "1) Which human skills are hardest for AI to replace?\nAI can sound right while being wrong. That is why your role is not to accept outputs at face value but to notice missing assumptions, wrong units, shaky causal stories, and conclusions that don’t fit the real-world context. The best way to build this filter is to deepen yourself in at least one domain this semester—data analytics, economics, finance, marketing, accounting, or another field you care about. As your domain knowledge grows, your prompts get sharper, your checks get stronger, and your conversations with AI become more productive.\nHumans also excel at problem-finding and framing. AI follows instructions; it rarely chooses the right question. Practice translating vague goals like “make a dashboard” into precise, checkable tasks such as “track weekly active users and cohort retention, then write a three-line narrative with drivers and caveats.” That skill of turning fog into a plan is a durable career advantage.\nCreativity is another human edge. AI is excellent at variations and remixing patterns, but original direction—choosing the audience, message, and the unexpected connection across fields—still comes from people. Use AI to explore possibilities, then you decide what actually matters and why.\nFinally, context, teamwork, judgment, and ethics remain stubbornly human. Reading the room, negotiating with classmates, persuading a client, balancing fairness and privacy, and taking responsibility for outcomes are hard to mechanize. AI can optimize, but humans choose values. You are accountable for the recommendation you make and the impact it has."

    "text": "2) What the evidence says about capability expansion\n\n\n\nExhibit 2 – GenAI Significantly Improved Performance in Three Data-Science Tasks\n\n\nThe figure compares people working without AI to those working with AI on tasks that were outside their comfort zones, with 100% set to the performance of professional data scientists. The headline result is that AI can immediately boost a beginner’s performance on structured tasks. In coding and data cleaning, for example, AI-augmented beginners reached roughly 86% of expert level, whereas those without AI hovered around the mid-30s. Translated into student life, this means you can merge messy datasets, fix obvious anomalies, and surface top customers or categories far faster—if you still sanity-check edge cases and data types.\nThe gains are more modest on fuzzier tasks like predictive analytics, especially when students paste the entire assignment into a single prompt. The groups who did best decomposed the work into steps (train/test split, features, baseline, metric), asked the model for intermediate artifacts, and verified them. A similar pattern shows up in statistical interpretation: when students requested pieces like residual plots or confusion matrices and inspected them, their results moved closer to expert practice. The practical reading is simple: AI can help you perform like a stronger student today, but performance is not the same as learning. Real understanding still requires practice, reflection, and feedback.\nThis matters for careers as well. If employers start recognizing AI fluency—through projects, portfolios, and practical certifications—you will need to show both that you can deliver results with AI and that you understand what the results mean. Being able to explain choices, defend assumptions, and spot failure modes will separate candidates who merely use AI from those who can be trusted with it."

    "text": "3) How to prepare for a world where AI does many technical tasks better than people\nBegin shifting from doing to directing. Expect AI to draft code, summarize readings, and generate baseline analyses. Your value moves upstream: define the goal, clarify constraints, set acceptance tests, and make the final call. Before you prompt, write a short spec that states the objective, the audience and data limits, and the conditions under which you will accept the result. Treat the model as a fast assistant inside a process you control.\nAdopt the engineering mindset even if you never become a software engineer. Break big problems into small, testable steps; ask for intermediate artifacts you can check (schemas, sample rows, metrics); and only then assemble the final answer. Make verification routine rather than an afterthought: compare against a simple baseline, run a quick stress test or counterexample, ensure units and magnitudes make sense, and note sources and data lineage. Consistent, lightweight QA beats last-minute fixes.\nProtect your intuition with manual mode. For your courses, make it a habit to work manually on purpose: push through problem sets on your own, draft essays from scratch, and code starting with a blank file. These efforts build the mental models you’ll need for exams, interviews, and real-world projects. Many instructors grade the reasoning process, and some assignments are explicitly no-AI. Honor those rules and use them to get stronger.\nFinally, invest in learning agility and communication. Build a simple “learning stack” that might include one short tutorial, one article or paper, one conversation with a tutor or professor, and a one-page reflection. Track how quickly you can go from “don’t know” to “basic demo,” and aim to shorten that time over the semester. As AI multiplies outputs, synthesis and storytelling decide impact, so practice turning your work into a clear five-sentence brief: problem, method, result, limitation, and next step. This is the habit that will make you valuable in group projects now—and in internships soon."

It quantifies how much a single play increases or decreases a team’s chances of scoring compared to the situation before the play.\n\nHow EPA Works\nEvery play in football occurs within a specific context (down, distance, field position, time remaining, and score). Historical data is used to calculate the expected points (EP) a team can expect to score from their current situation. EPA is the difference between the expected points after the play and before the play.\n\n\nFormula:\n\\[\nEPA = EP (\\text{after the play}) - EP (\\text{before the play})\n\\]\n\n\nKey Insights:\n\nPositive EPA: The play improved the team’s scoring chances.\n\n\nExample: A 20-yard pass on 3rd and 8 increases the likelihood of scoring.\n\n\nNegative EPA: The play reduced the team’s scoring chances.\n\nExample: A sack or an interception harms the team’s scoring potential.\n\n\n\n\nWhy EPA Is Important\n\nContextual: Accounts for situational factors, making it more informative than raw stats like yards gained.\nPlay Evaluation: Helps determine the effectiveness of specific plays or players.\nStrategic Decisions: Assists coaches and analysts in evaluating decisions like when to go for it on 4th down.\n\n\n\nApplications\n\nOffensive EPA: Evaluates how well a team’s offense increases scoring opportunities.\nDefensive EPA: Measures how effectively a defense reduces the opposing team’s scoring potential.\nPlayer Performance: Used to assess quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, and defenders by their contribution to scoring or preventing points."

    "section": "Corsi and Fenwick Metrics",
    "text": "Corsi and Fenwick Metrics\nCorsi and Fenwick are two of the earliest advanced analytics used to measure player effectiveness in hockey. For over a century, traditional metrics such as goals, assists, and penalty minutes were the main tools for evaluating players. The plus-minus rating, which tracks the number of goals scored by a player’s team minus the goals allowed while they are on the ice, added some depth. However, this metric has a significant flaw: it often reflects the quality of a player’s teammates. For instance, a lower-skilled player might have a great plus-minus rating simply by playing alongside scoring superstars like Auston Matthews or Sidney Crosby.\nCorsi and Fenwick provide a more nuanced measure of effectiveness. Corsi calculates the difference in shot attempts (shots on goal, missed shots, and blocked shots) by a player’s team versus their opponents while the player is on the ice. Fenwick is similar but excludes blocked shots. Both metrics are typically applied to specific game situations, such as:\n\n5-on-5 (Even Strength): The most common game state, where each team has five skaters on the ice, excluding goalies. Corsi and Fenwick in this situation are considered the most reliable indicators of player performance since it minimizes the influence of special teams.\n5-on-4 (Power Play): A situation where the player’s team has a one-man advantage due to an opponent’s penalty. Metrics in this scenario provide insight into how effectively a player contributes to creating offensive opportunities.\n4-on-5 (Penalty Kill): A situation where the player’s team is at a one-man disadvantage. Here, Corsi and Fenwick can help measure a player’s ability to limit opponent shot attempts and maintain defensive stability.\nOther Situations: Includes rarer scenarios like 4-on-4, 3-on-3 overtime, or 6-on-5 when a team pulls its goalie for an extra attacker. Metrics in these cases are less common but still useful for specific analyses.\nAll Situations: Aggregates data from every possible game state, offering a broader view of a player’s performance but often less precise for evaluating specific roles or responsibilities.\n\nWhile these metrics are often expressed as raw differences, they can also be analyzed as percentages. For instance, we can calculate a player’s Corsi percentage by dividing the Corsi “for” (shot attempts by the player’s team) by the sum of the Corsi “for” and Corsi “against” (shot attempts by the opposing team). This provides a clearer picture of a player’s overall effectiveness on the ice."

    "section": "Time on Ice by Position",
    "text": "Time on Ice by Position\nIt is rare for skaters to play even half of a game, unlike goalkeepers, who generally play the entire match. For this analysis, we will focus on skaters and exclude goalkeepers. Managing a team effectively requires ensuring players are not overly fatigued, especially during the final minutes of a game or during stretches with multiple games and minimal rest. To address this, we use the “time on ice” (TOI) metric. TOI varies by position. NHL teams typically have four offensive lines (left wing, center, right wing) but only three defensive pairs. As a result, defensemen tend to play more minutes both in individual games and throughout the season. Special situations such as power plays or penalty kills can also affect TOI distribution. For instance:\n\nPower Plays (5-on-4): Offensive players on the power play units often have increased TOI in these scenarios to maximize scoring opportunities.\nPenalty Kills (4-on-5): Defensive players and penalty kill specialists tend to play more minutes during penalties to mitigate scoring threats.\nOvertime (3-on-3): In regular-season overtime, top players are typically deployed for longer shifts due to the fast-paced and open nature of play.\n\nUnderstanding TOI in these different contexts helps coaches optimize player utilization and prevent fatigue over the course of a game or season.\n\nGeneral Terms Description\n\nExpected Goals\n\nThe sum of the probabilities of unblocked shot attempts being goals.\nFor example, a rebound shot in the slot may be worth 0.5 expected goals, while a shot from the blueline while short handed may be worth 0.01 expected goals.\nThe expected value of each shot attempt is calculated by the MoneyPuck Expected Goals model.\nExpected goals is commonly abbreviated as “xGoals”. Blocked shot attempts are valued at 0 xGoals.\nSee more here: http://moneypuck.com/about.htm#shotModel\n\nScore Adjusted\n\nAdjusts metrics to gives more credit to away teams and teams with large leads.\n\nFlurry Adjusted\n\nSee http://moneypuck.com/about.htm#flurry\n\nI_F\n\n“Individual For”.\nFor stats credited to an individual.\nFor example, I_F_goals is the number of goals a player has scored\n\nOnIce_F\n\n“On-ice For”.\nEvery player on the ice on the team doing the event receives credit.\nOnIce_F_goals is the number of goals the player’s team has scored while that player is on the ice, regardless of if they were the one who scored the goal or not.\n\nOnIce_A\n\n“On-ice Against”.\nEvery opposing team’s players on the ice on receives credit. OnIce_A_goals is the number of goals the player’s team has given up while the player is on the ice\n\nOffIce_F\n\n“Off-ice For”.\nEvery player on the bench of the team doing the event receives “credit”.\nOffIce_F_goals is the number of goals the player’s team has scored while that player is on the bench.\n\nOffIce_A\n\n“Off-ice Against”.\nEvery player on the opposing team’s bench of the team doing the event receives “credit”.\nOffIce_A_goals is the number of goals the player’s team has given up while that player is on the bench.\n\nLow Danger Shots\n\nUnblocked Shot attempts with a &lt; 8% probability of being a goal. Low danger shots accounts for ~75% of shots and ~33% of goals\n\nMedium Danger Shots\n\nUnblocked Shot attempts with between &gt;=8% but less than 20% probability of being a goal.\nMedium danger shots account for ~20% of shots and ~33% of goals\n\nHigh Danger Shots\n\nUnblocked Shot attempts with &gt;= 20% probability of being a goal.\nHigh danger shots account for ~5% of shots and ~33% of goals\n\nCreated Expected Goals\n\nSee http://moneypuck.com/about.htm#xRebounds"

    "section": "Four Factors",
    "text": "Four Factors\nThe “four factors” concept, developed by Dean Oliver and detailed in his book Basketball on Paper (available at basketballonpaper.com), outlines the key elements contributing to a team’s success. Oliver originally assigned the following weights to these factors: shooting (40%), turnovers (25%), rebounding (20%), and free throws (15%). While the exact weighting is often debated, the importance of these four factors is widely recognized. They are critical not only for understanding a team’s offensive efficiency but also for evaluating defensive performance (e.g., analyzing the opponent’s effective field goal percentage). The four factors are:\n\nEffective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%)\nTurnovers Committed per Possession\nOffensive Rebounding Percentage (ORP)\nFree Throw Rate (FTR)\n\n\nEffective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%)\nEffective field goal percentage adjusts for the difference in value between two-point and three-point shots, giving three-pointers 50% more weight since they are worth 50% more points. The formula for EFG% is:\n\\[\nEFG = \\frac{fg2m + 1.5 \\times fg3m}{fga}\n\\] Where\n\nfg2m: Number of two-point field goals made\nfg3m: Number of three-point field goals made\nfga: Total field goals attempted\n\n\n\nTurnovers Committed per Possession\nThis metric measures how often a team turns the ball over relative to the number of possessions they have in a game. It highlights a team’s ball-handling efficiency by considering turnovers (tov) in relation to total possessions (poss).\n\n\nOffensive Rebounding Percentage\nOffensive rebounding percentage evaluates a team’s ability to secure offensive rebounds compared to the total number of available offensive rebounds. The formula is:\n\\[\nORP = \\frac{\\text{Team Offensive Rebounds}}{\\text{Team Offensive Rebounds + Opponent Offensive Rebounds}}\n\\]\n\n\nFree Throw Rate\nFree throw rate measures how frequently a team attempts free throws compared to its total field goal attempts. The formula is:\n\\[\nFTR = \\frac{\\text{Free Throw Attempts (fta)}}{\\text{Field Goal Attempts (fga)}}\n\\]"

    "text": "🏌️ Basic Golf Concepts\nBefore interpreting the variables, here are two essential ideas:\n\n1. A “stroke” is one hit of the ball.\nFewer strokes = better scoring.\n\n\n2. Every hole has a “par.”\nPar is the expected number of strokes a skilled player should take:\n- 3 strokes → par\n- Par: target number of strokes for a hole (usually 3, 4, or 5).\n\nstrokes == hole_par → “made par”\n\nstrokes = par – 1 → birdie (good)\n\nstrokes = par + 1 → bogey (bad)\n\nIdea: strokes gained numbers tell us whether the player is better or worse than the PGA Tour average for that type of shot.\n\nPositive value → better than average\n\nNegative value → worse than average\n\n\n\n3. Tournaments have multiple rounds.\nMost events have 4 rounds (Thu–Sun), each of 18 holes.\n\n\n4. There is a “cut” after round 2.\nOnly the best players continue to round 3–4. Others “miss the cut.”\n\nTournament: usually 4 rounds (4 × 18 holes).\n\nCut: after 2 rounds, only players with the best scores continue to rounds 3–4."

    "section": "Expected Goals and Assists",
    "text": "Expected Goals and Assists\nSoccer is renowned for its low-scoring nature. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, 172 goals were scored across 64 matches, averaging 2.68 goals per match—the highest average in World Cup history. Despite this, seven matches ended scoreless. The element of luck significantly influences goal scoring, and occasionally, players inadvertently score own goals. To better quantify scoring opportunities and player performance, the soccer analytics community has introduced expected goals (xG) as a metric to measure the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal.\nVarious models calculate xG, but fundamentally, it represents the probability of scoring from a specific spot on the field when a shot is taken. Factors considered in xG calculations include:\n\nBody Part Used: Whether the shot was taken with the head or foot.\nType of Play: How the player received the ball (e.g., cross, set piece).\nGoalkeeper Positioning: The location and readiness of the goalkeeper.\nPlayer Positioning: Positions of teammates and opponents between the shooter and the goal.\nDefensive Pressure: How tightly defenders are marking the shooter.\nAdditional Situational Variables: Other measurable factors that may affect shot success.\n\nSince most shots do not result in goals, and many passes to shooters lead to missed opportunities, an analogous metric called expected assists (xA) evaluates the likelihood that a pass will lead to a goal. These metrics are often normalized per 90 minutes—denoted as xG per 90 or xA per 90—to allow fair comparisons between players with varying playing times.\nPlayers consistently achieving high xG values are those who frequently position themselves advantageously on the field. Coaches and scouts use xG and xA metrics to assess whether a player’s performance is influenced by luck over multiple games and to evaluate offensive skills beyond basic statistics."

The term was listed in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following month as a “slang & trending” term. (Wikipedia, 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are HTML and JS?\n\n\n\n\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages.\n\nIt defines the structure of a webpage.\n\nA webpage is made up of HTML elements.\n\nThese elements instruct the browser on how to display the content.\n\nJavaScript (JS) is a programming language that enhances web interactivity.\n\nIt runs directly in the user’s browser, reducing server load. \nIt enables dynamic content, user interactions, and animations.\n\nAnalogy:\n\nHTML = The structure of a house (walls, roof, foundation).\n\nJS = The interactive elements (automatic doors, lights, smart devices).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Start with this prompt (use exactly):\n\n“Create a single-file HTML/JS page to play perfect tic-tac-toe vs. human.”\n\n\ne.g., Prof. Choe’s Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nStep 1-1 Prepare your text editor:\n\n\nWindows\n\nPress the Windows key, type Notepad, and press Enter.\n\nPaste the HTML code from your AI.\n\nGo to File → Save As.\n\nChange Save as type to All Files.\n\nEnter a name like tic-tac-toe.html.\n\nSelect the location (Desktop, Documents, etc.).\n\nSet Encoding to UTF-8.\n\nClick Save.\n\n\nDouble-click the file to open it in your default browser (Edge, Chrome, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nMac\nSet up TextEdit (one-time)\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Command + Space to open Spotlight.\n\nType TextEdit and press Enter.\n\nPress Command + , to open Settings.\n\nUnder Format, select Plain Text.\n\n\nQuit TextEdit (Command + Q).\n\nRe-open TextEdit for coding\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Command + Space, type TextEdit, and press Enter.\n\nClick Show Options.\n\nUnder Plain Text Encoding, select Unicode (UTF-8).\n\n\nClick New Document.\n\nPaste the HTML code from your generative AI.\n\nSave the file (Command + S):\n\nName it tic-tac-toe.html.\n\nEnsure the extension is .html.\n\nChoose a location (Desktop, Documents, etc.).\n\nClick Save, and if prompted, choose Use .html.\n\n\nDouble-click the file to open it in your default browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.).\n\n\n\nStep 2. Add an option for two-player mode.\n\ne.g., Prof. Choe’s Tic-Tac-Toe with the Two-player Mode\n\n\nStep 3.

As we walk through the results, I’ll point out where I use\nfilter(), select(), and left_join() to Transform your responses and Load a clean analysis table we can analyze.\nBig idea: Your responses become a relational dataset, and then we join in algorithm rules — the same way TikTok, Instagram, or Reddit enrich user logs before ranking your feed.\n\n\n\nFeed Algorithm\n\n“Do you think your feed reflects your choices — or the platform’s choices about you?”\n\n\nWe’ll look at platform behavior patterns using your data:\nminutes, posting activity, device type, and interaction style.\nThen we’ll run an algorithm simulation using a random card draw system to show how the same minutes can be valued very differently depending on the platform’s ranking logic.\n\n\n\n🧠 Feed Algorithm Interpretation Using Card Mechanics\nTo illustrate how platforms differ in engagement efficiency, we treat each minute of screen time like drawing a card:\n\nRank (2–10, J, Q, K, A) → how strong your engagement signal was\n\nSuit (platform personality) → how that platform interprets and amplifies that engagement\n\nYou’ll see that not all platforms reward the same behavior equally — some love viral spikes, some love steady engagement.\n\n🎭 Platform Algorithm Personalities — Rank Bias Model\nEach platform doesn’t just apply a fixed multiplier — it biases specific rank categories (Face, Ace, Mid, etc.).\nThis models how TikTok boosts viral spikes, Reddit rewards slower thread engagement, and YouTube locks users into deep watch sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nAlgorithm Personality\nRank Preference Pattern\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n♠ Strategic viral retention — aggressively hunts viral spikes\nFace → Ace → 10 (very spike-oriented, punishes low/no engagement)\n\n\nInstagram / Threads\n♦ Aesthetic/status curation — polished trend amplification\n10 → Face → Mid (reward polished content, suppress low-value scroll)\n\n\nYouTube\n♠ Strategic deep retention — optimizes long session depth\nAce → 10 → Mid (not chaotic, but strong on intentional consumption)\n\n\nReddit / Discord\n♣ Community depth — favors threads, steady engagement over spikes\nMid → Ace → 10, downweights Face spikes (less about virality)\n\n\nSnapchat\n♥ Emotional burst algorithm — high volatility, short attention loops\nFace spikes allowed, but low ranks common (chaotic scroll-emotion mix)\n\n\nX/Twitter\n♣ Fast discourse loop — rewards mid-level interaction & repost energy\nMid + Face modest bias, suppresses dead scrolling\n\n\nFacebook\n♦ Legacy ranking — mild engagement shaping, mostly neutral\nSlight mid bias, nearly flat weighting otherwise\n\n\nNone\nNeutral baseline — no algorithm shaping\nAll rank_adj = 1.00 (control group)\n\n\n\n\n\n🎮 Rank Interpretation (Base Weights Before Platform Influence)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank Category\nBase Weight\nMeaning in Attention Model\n\n\n\n\nJoker (0)\n1.00\nPassive drift — counted time, no engagement signal\n\n\n2–4 (Low ranks)\n1.00\nGlance-scroll, content seen without response\n\n\n5–9 (Mid ranks)\n1.05\nLight scrolling or minor interaction — retention signal\n\n\n10\n1.10\nHigh interest moment — actively watching or reading\n\n\nAce (A)\n1.25\nIntentional engagement — searching, saving, deep dwell\n\n\nFace Cards (J/Q/K)\n1.50\nEmotional/viral spike — strong reaction triggers\n\n\n\n\n🚩 Raw minutes = counting cards without considering rank or suit.\n🎯 Algorithm-adjusted attention = calculating your true score based on both rank (quality of engagement) and suit (type of platform algorithm).\n\nIn other words:\n\nA 20-minute session on Instagram Reels (♦ Ace) scores high adjusted attention.\nA 40-minute YouTube autoplay binge (♠ Joker) has high raw minutes but almost no algorithm-weighted value.\nTwo users can spend the same time, but their card draws (attention efficiency) differ by platform.\n\nTikTok may reward spike engagement, while Reddit rewards steady browsing.\nYouTube may ignore your first 10 minutes, but heavily weight the moment you intentionally engage.\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ Key Takeaway\n\nAlgorithms don’t just count your time — they interpret and score it.\nSome platforms are time sinks, while others are attention amplifiers — even if the minutes look the same.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nIf platforms score and rank your behavior in secret, should users be allowed to know their score — or is it okay for the system to stay hidden?\nIf a platform is designed to keep you scrolling even when the content is low-value, is it ethical to design for addiction instead of meaningful use?"

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nSports Analytics\nThe application of analytics to business problems is a key skill that is essential to learn. Many of these techniques are now being applied to improve decision making in all aspects of sports, a very hot area called sports analytics. Sports analytics is the art and science of gathering data about athletes and teams to create insights that improve sports decisions, such as deciding which players to recruit, how much to pay them, who to play, how to train them, how to keep them healthy, and when they should be traded or retired. For teams, it involves business decisions such as ticket pricing, as well as opposition research, analysis of each competitor’s strengths and weaknesses, and many game-day decisions.\nThe use of analytics for sports was popularized by the Moneyball book by Michael Lewis in 2003 and the movie starring Brad Pitt in 2011. It showcased Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane and his use of data and analytics to turn a losing team into a winner.\nIn particular, he hired an analyst who used analytics to draft players able to get on base as opposed to players who excelled at traditional measures like runs batted in or stolen bases. These insights allowed them to draft prospects overlooked by other teams at reasonable starting salaries. It worked—they made it to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.\nAs an Industry, sports worldwide is a multibillion-dollar industry. A report by Statista.com showed the size of the worldwide sports industry in 2018 itself to be almost $471 billion. Estimates vary widely, but according to Rice University, a conservative estimate of this industry’s current size is about $500 billion. This estimate includes various professional athletic leagues as well as college sports. According to some reports, college sports in the United States represent an $18 billion-dollar industry. Suffice it to say that sports is a major economic driver of activity in the United States and in many countries around the world.\nSports analytics is becoming a specialty within analytics. It is an important area because sports is a big business. In 2014, $125M was spent on analytics. A recent report produced by Grand View Research estimates that in 2020 the sports analytics industry had already grown to $885M, and is expected to grow at a staggering growth rate of over 27% per year. Thus, sports analytics is not only a fun way to learn about analytics, but it is also a potential career option for many graduates of analytics programs.\nAnalytics are being used in all parts of sports. The following framework presents a simple way to understand potential analytics applications in sports. The top layer points out the potential for the usual business office/administrative analytics like allocating budget dollars across multiple sports in colleges, or determining the mix of money spent on facilities vs. coaches and trainers vs. player salaries and benefits. The next two layers of analytics can be divided between the front office and back office (often called Business and Operations). Front-office business analytics include analyzing fan behavior ranging from predictive models for season ticket renewals and regular ticket sale pricing, to scoring tweets by fans regarding the team, athletes, coaches, and owners. This is very similar to traditional customer relationship management (CRM). For individual players, there is a focus on recruitment models and scouting analytics. Financial analysis is also a key area, where salary caps on rosters (for pros) or scholarship limits (colleges) are part of the equation.\nBack-office uses include analytics to improve a team’s operation as well as for health and safety of the players. Team analytics include strategies and tactics, competitive assessments, and optimal lineup choices under various on-field or on-court situations. Health/safety analytics focus on medical, strength and fitness as well as development, and predictive models for avoiding overtraining and injuries. Concussion research is a hot field, for example.\nFinally, the bottom layer points out the potential for application of analytics at the league/conference level to optimize schedules and locations of games across a pool of teams, including tournament seeding.\nThe following representative examples illustrate how various sports organizations use data and analytics to improve sports operations, in the same way analytics have improved traditional industry decision making. Almost all of these are based on actual projects conducted by students and researchers. In some cases, the names have been changed to protect identity of the stakeholders.\nExample 1: The Business Office—Fan Analytics\nKatie Ward works as a business analyst for a major pro baseball team, focusing on revenue. She analyzes ticket sales, both from season ticket holders as well as single-ticket buyers. Sample questions in her area of responsibility include why season ticket holders renew (or do not renew) their tickets, as well as what factors drive last-minute individual seat ticket purchases. Another question is how to price the tickets.\nSome of the analytical techniques Katie uses include simple statistics on fan behavior like overall attendance and answers to survey questions about likelihood to purchase again. However, what fans say versus what they do can be different. Katie runs a survey of fans by ticket seat location (“tier”) and asks about their likelihood of renewing their season tickets. But when she compares what they say versus what they do, she discovers big differences. She found that 69% of fans in Tier 1 seats who said on the survey that they would “probably not” renew actually did. This is a useful insight that leads to action—customers who are most likely to renew tickets require fewer marketing touches and dollars to convert, for example, compared to customers who are “on the edge.”\nHowever, many factors influence fan ticket purchase behavior, especially price, which drives more sophisticated statistics and data analysis. For both areas, but especially single-game tickets, Katie is driving the use of dynamic pricing—moving the business from simple static pricing by seat location tier to day-by-day up-and-down pricing of individual seats. This is a rich research area for many sports teams and has huge upside potential for revenue enhancement. For example, her pricing takes into account the team’s record, who they are playing, game dates and times, which star athletes play for each team, each fan’s history of renewing season tickets or buying single tickets, as well as factors like seat location, number of seats, and real-time information like traffic congestion historically at game time and even the weather.\nWhich of these factors are important? How much? Given her extensive statistics background, Katie builds regression models to pick out key factors driving these historic behaviors and create predictive models to identify how to spend marketing resources to drive revenues. She builds churn models for season ticket holders to create segments of customers who will renew, won’t renew, or are fence-sitters, which then drives more refined marketing campaigns.\nIn addition, she does sentiment scoring on fan comments like tweets that help her segment fans into different loyalty segments. Other studies about single-game attendance drivers help the marketing department understand the impact of giveaways like bobble-heads or T-shirts, or suggestions on where to make spot TV ad buys.\nBeyond revenues, there are many other analytical areas that Katie’s team works on, including merchandising, TV and radio broadcast revenues, inputs to the general manager on salary negotiations, draft analytics especially given salary caps, promotion effectiveness including advertising channels, and brand awareness, as well as partner analytics.\nExample 2: The College Football Coach—Play Tactics\nBob Breedlove is the football coach for a major college team. For him, it’s all about winning games. His areas of focus include recruiting the best high school players, developing them to fit his offense and defense systems, and getting maximum effort from them on game days. Sample questions in his area of responsibility include: Who do we recruit? What drills help develop their skills? How hard do I push our athletes? Where are opponents strong or weak, and how do we figure out their play tendencies?\nFortunately, his team has hired a new team operation expert, Dar Beranek, who specializes in helping the coaches make tactical decisions. She is working with a team of student interns who are creating opponent analytics. They used the coach’s annotated game film to build a cascaded decision tree model to predict whether the next play will be a running play or passing play. This shows some tendencies they might want to exploit. For example, when they see a personnel formation that looks like a pass, and it’s third or fourth down with more than 5 yards to go, their opponent team passes 95.45% of the time—very predictable!\n\nReference\n\nSharda and Turban - Business Intelligence, Analytics, Data Science, and AI (5th Edition), Ch.1.\n\n⚠️ Note: These excerpts from the above article are shared under fair use for educational purposes to support your learning.\n\n\n\nBusiness Intelligence\nBusiness intelligence (BI) is a set of technological processes for collecting, managing and analyzing organizational data to yield insights that inform business strategies and operations.\nBusiness intelligence analysts transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making within an organization. BI tools enable business users to access different types of data, historical and current, third-party and in-house, as well as semistructured data and unstructured data such as social media. Users can analyze this information to gain insights into how the business is performing and what it should do next.\nAccording to CIO magazine: “Although business intelligence does not tell business users what to do or what will happen if they take a certain course, neither is BI only about generating reports. Rather, BI offers a way for people to examine data to understand trends and derive insights.”\nOrganizations can use the insights gained from BI and data analysis to improve business decisions, identify problems or issues, spot market trends and find new revenue or business opportunities.\n\nHow BI works\nThe steps taken in BI usually flow in this order:\n\nData sources: Identify the data to be reviewed and analyzed, such as from a data warehouse or data lake, cloud, Hadoop, industry statistics, supply chain, CRM, inventory, pricing, sales, marketing or social media.\nData collection: Gather and clean data from various sources. This data preparation might be manually gathering information in a spreadsheet or an automatic extract, transform and load (ETL) program.\nAnalysis: Look for trends or unexpected results in the data. This might use data mining, data discovery or data modeling tools.\nVisualization: Create data visualizations, graphs and dashboards that use business intelligence tools such as Tableau, Cognos Analytics, Microsoft Excel or SAP. Ideally this visualization includes drill-down, drill-through, drill-up features to enable users to investigate various data levels.\nAction plan: Develop actionable insights based on analysis of historical data versus key performance indicators (KPIs). Actions might include more efficient processes, changes in marketing, fixing supply chain issues or adapting customer experience issues.\n\nSome newer BI products can extract and load raw data directly by using technology such as Hadoop, but data warehouses often remain the data source of choice.\n\n\nReference\n\nIBM - What is business intelligence (BI)?\n\n⚠️ Note: These excerpts from the above article are shared under fair use for educational purposes to support your learning.\n\n\n\nCo-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI\n\nRead: Introduction and Chapter 1"

The correct condition for keeping scores between 80 and 90 inclusive requires using &gt;= and &lt;=. Option a is incorrect because it excludes 80 and 90, while options c and d use | (OR), which selects scores either greater than or equal to 80 or less than or equal to 90, which is not the intended condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 32\nWhich of the following expressions correctly keeps observations from df where the age variable has missing values?\n\ndf |&gt; filter(is.na(age))\ndf |&gt; filter(!is.na(age))\ndf |&gt; filter(age == NA)\ndf |&gt; filter(age != NA)\nBoth a and c\nBoth b and d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; filter(is.na(age))\n\nExplanation: The function is.na() checks for missing values (NA).

Option b filters for non-missing values, which is not what the question asks."

In skewed distributions or datasets with extreme highs/lows, the median provides a more robust and representative summary.

It is difficult because advanced AI systems can optimize objectives in ways that technically satisfy a metric but violate human intent—this is the “single-objective optimizer” failure mode. When a model pushes one goal to an extreme without broader context or value constraints, it can generate harmful or unintended outcomes even while maximizing its target metric.\nWhy companies alone cannot solve it:\n\nCompanies face pressure to deploy quickly for competitive advantage, which may lead to cutting corners on long-term safety and value alignment.\nCorporate profit incentives do not necessarily align with broader public welfare and ethical standards, especially in global contexts beyond their direct accountability.\n\nWhy governments alone cannot solve it:\n\nGovernments often lack the technical expertise and agility to regulate fast-moving AI developments effectively.\nGlobal AI deployment crosses jurisdictions, and national policies cannot fully enforce alignment across private-sector labs or international competitors without global coordination.\n\nWhat is needed:\nAn effective solution requires collaboration between researchers, companies, governments, and international institutions.

This connection helps viewers naturally perceive trends, patterns, growth, and cycles across periods. It is especially useful in time-series data because it reinforces the idea of continuity and change over time rather than treating each observation as isolated."

    "text": "Question 25\nFor each of the workplaces represented by our three alumni guest speakers, explain how generative AI is used in their day-to-day work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the three alumni workplaces, generative AI is integrated into daily workflows in different but complementary ways.\nAt the analytics and engineering–focused workplace, many employees (roughly 60–80%) use AI assistants such as Copilot or Claude to support coding, debugging, and data processing. AI significantly speeds up routine analytical tasks, but all outputs still require human review, meaning AI augments rather than replaces analysts.\nFor a traditional data analyst role, generative AI is commonly used to assist with SQL coding, data summarization, and report drafting. Analysts rely on AI to improve efficiency, but data sensitivity and responsible AI use are essential, so such tools are typically deployed only within secure internal environments.\nAt the policy and government-related workplace (e.g., the Federal Reserve), the use of public AI tools like ChatGPT is prohibited due to strict data confidentiality rules. Instead, analysts rely on approved internal systems and traditional analytical tools to protect sensitive economic and financial information.\nTogether, these examples show how generative AI is widely used to increase productivity, while security, privacy, and human oversight remain central across all workplaces."

This can make patterns within each facet more visible, especially when the data ranges vary significantly between facets.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nDifficulty in Comparison: When scales are free, comparing values across facets becomes challenging because the axes are not standardized. Viewers might misinterpret the data, thinking that similar bar heights represent similar values, even if the scales differ."

    "text": "Question 25\nFor each of the workplaces represented by our three alumni guest speakers, explain how generative AI is used in their day-to-day work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the three alumni workplaces, generative AI is integrated into daily workflows in different but complementary ways.\nAt the analytics and engineering–focused workplace, many employees (roughly 60–80%) use AI assistants such as Copilot or Claude to support coding, debugging, and data processing. AI significantly speeds up routine analytical tasks, but all outputs still require human review, meaning AI augments rather than replaces analysts.\nFor a traditional data analyst role, generative AI is commonly used to assist with SQL coding, data summarization, and report drafting. Analysts rely on AI to improve efficiency, but data sensitivity and responsible AI use are essential, so such tools are typically deployed only within secure internal environments.\nAt the policy and government-related workplace (e.g., the Federal Reserve), the use of public AI tools like ChatGPT is prohibited due to strict data confidentiality rules. Instead, analysts rely on approved internal systems and traditional analytical tools to protect sensitive economic and financial information.\nTogether, these examples show how generative AI is widely used to increase productivity, while security, privacy, and human oversight remain central across all workplaces."

Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionized empirical research.\nFor Questions 37-40, consider the following R packages and the data.frame, ak91_age, which comes from the 1980 US Census and covers men born 1930–1939, which is used by Joshua Angrist and Alan Krueger’s research article.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nak91_age &lt;- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/ak91_ageW.csv')\n\nThe first 20 observations in the ak91_age data frame are displayed below:\n\n\n\n\n\nQoB\nYoB\nYoBQ\nW\nEduc\nQ4\n\n\n\n\n1\n1930\n1930.00\n361.0922\n12.28041\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1931\n1931.00\n365.8181\n12.54043\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1932\n1932.00\n364.9678\n12.53393\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1933\n1933.00\n362.1093\n12.67319\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1934\n1934.00\n363.2739\n12.64726\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1935\n1935.00\n357.7532\n12.65091\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1936\n1936.00\n359.5803\n12.74304\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1937\n1937.00\n362.5073\n12.83230\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1938\n1938.00\n362.9918\n12.93868\nFALSE\n\n\n1\n1939\n1939.00\n360.0860\n13.00299\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1930\n1930.25\n364.3105\n12.42842\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1931\n1931.25\n365.2228\n12.53105\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1932\n1932.25\n365.2356\n12.60960\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1933\n1933.25\n365.2171\n12.63471\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1934\n1934.25\n362.2778\n12.72797\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1935\n1935.25\n360.1939\n12.79693\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1936\n1936.25\n360.2046\n12.81108\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1937\n1937.25\n360.7164\n12.84405\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1938\n1938.25\n366.8558\n13.00766\nFALSE\n\n\n2\n1939\n1939.25\n365.9290\n13.01340\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ak91_age data frame is with 40 observations and 6 variables.\n\n\nDescription of Variables in ak91_age:\n\nQoB: Quarter of birth\nYoB: Year of birth (1930, 1931, …, 1939)\nYoBQ: Year and quarter of birth (1930 Q1, 1930 Q2, …, 1939 Q4)\nW: Wage per week\nEduc: Years of education\nQ4: TRUE if quarter of birth is 4; FALSE otherwise.\n\n\nThe followings are the summary of the ak91_age data.frame, including descriptive statistics for each variable.\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nak91_age\n\n\nNumber of rows\n40\n\n\nNumber of columns\n6\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nlogical\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: logical\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\nmean\ncount\n\n\n\n\nQ4\n0\n0.25\nFAL: 30, TRU: 10\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\n\n\n\n\nQoB\n0\n2.50\n1.13\n1.00\n1.75\n2.50\n3.25\n4.00\n\n\nYoB\n0\n1934.50\n2.91\n1930.00\n1932.00\n1934.50\n1937.00\n1939.00\n\n\nYoBQ\n0\n1934.88\n2.92\n1930.00\n1932.44\n1934.88\n1937.31\n1939.75\n\n\nW\n0\n365.02\n3.37\n357.75\n362.24\n365.53\n367.89\n370.32\n\n\nEduc\n0\n12.76\n0.19\n12.28\n12.64\n12.75\n12.93\n13.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 37\nHere we describe the quarterly trend of years of education.
